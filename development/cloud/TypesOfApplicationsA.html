<h1>Understanding the Cloud</h1>
<p>There are three primary types of Cloud Services:</p>
<ul>
<li>SaaS - Software as a Service</li>
<li>SaaS - Software as a Service</li>
<li>IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service</li>
</ul>
<p>Software as a Service is a generic term for an application that runs in
the cloud. The classic example of this type of service is Google Docs.
Platform as a Service is a generic term for fully configured and
maintained development services found in the cloud, such as a web
server, a database, or an application framework of some kind. The EC2
Amazon Web Services are classic example of Infrastructure as a Service.
You can run a database or web server on top of IaaS, but you are
responsible for configuring it. That is the key difference between IaaS
and PaaS. With IaaS you get an OS running in a VM and it is up to you to
configure it. With a PaaS such as Amazon S3, you get a preconfigured and
fully maintained web server, but you are not completely in control of
it. It is, in a sense, easier to use than an Apache server that you set
up yourself, but it is not as flexible.</p>
<p>Take a moment to consider the difference between a cloud application
like Microsoft SkyDrive or Google Docs, and a platform like Apache on
Linux:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apache is a web server and can serve up HTML files and run scripts.
As such, it is enormously powerful and flexible. On the other hand,
it is not designed to allow you to edit a Word document.</li>
<li>SkyDrive will let you edit a Word document, but it does not serve up
HTML in the traditional sense.</li>
<li>A service like S3 lies in the middle between these extremes. It is a
preconfigured web server, but not as flexible as Apache on Linux.
For instance, it is not designed to serve up dynamic content
generated from a database.</li>
</ul>
<p>The lines between these things get fuzzy at times, but the fundamental
differences between a tool like EC2 (IaaS) , a tool like S3 (PaaS) and
SkyDrive (SaaS) should be clear:</p>
<ul>
<li>IaaS: The vendor gives you an OS running on Virtual Machine, and
leaves it up to your to configure it. You an install what you want,
but you need to know how to set it up and maintain it.</li>
<li>PaaS: The vendor gives you a pre-configured and fully maintained set
of development tools running in the cloud. If a web server is
involved, it is pre-installed and fully configured. You can&#39;t
install new features in a PaaS, it is a set of preconfigured tools.
With Apache, you can install new tools, or configure them to run a
particular way. In the process, you might break something. On a
PaaS, you can&#39;t install anything new, or change most of the options,
but it is fully maintained and ready to use out of the box.</li>
<li>SaaS: This is software running in the cloud. It is an end-user tool,
not a development tool. A word processor or a blogging platform
would be examples of SaaS.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a general rule, IaaS is the most powerful, and costs the most. PaaS
is easier to use, cost less, but is not usually as powerful or flexible.
It is, however, still a development platform. SaaS is frequently free,
or very low cost, but it lacks the flexibility of PaaS, since it is not
a development platform. As I said above, the lines may become a bit
blurred at times, but this is the basic overview.</p>
<p>If you grew up with Windows, or major products such as Microsoft Office,
you are probably used to thinking in terms of versions. You expect a
product to increment its version number once every one to two years, and
you expect major changes to happen at that time. This is not the way it
works in the cloud. Most, or at any rate many, cloud applications are
under continuous development in an agile development cycle. This means
that new features might appear at any time. This can be confusing.</p>
<p>We have grown accustomed to installing an application, examining its
features, and finding them either adequate or inadequate for our needs.
If you are using an cloud application such as Google Docs, however, you
might examine it in June and find that it is good, but not quite good
enough because it is missing one or two key features that you need. The
odd thing about cloud applications is that the feature you want might
show up next week, next month, six months from now, two years from now,
or never. The same is true for bugs. You might hit a bug in a product.
All your training tells you that the bug is a serious issue, in large
part because you will have to wait a year or two for the next release
before you will see it fixed. but in the cloud, a bug can be fixed much
more readily. Sometimes bugs are even fixed incrementally. For instance,
you might find that a document does not display correctly. You come back
in two weeks and find that its display is improved, but still not
perfect. Come back in six months, and the problem may be almost entirely
gone. In a year&#39;s time, there is no longer so much as a trace.</p>
<p>But how do we know when a bug will be fixed or when a new feature will
appear? Sometimes a vendor gives us detailed information about their
development plans, but even when they do, we frequently don&#39;t have time
to follow such matters. Overall, the ability of a team to iterate
frequently and to continue publish new releases is a good thing, but it
comes at a price.</p>

<h2>Key Issues</h2>
<a class="anchor" id="identity"></a>
<h3>Identity</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create your own</li>
<li>Open ID</li>
</ul>
<a class="anchor" id="stateless"></a>
<h3>Stateless</h3>
<p>Begin with an inventory</p>
<a class="anchor" id="entry-point-"></a>
<h2>Entry point:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Let&#39;s take this web application and put it into the cloud.</li>
<li>Some kinds of SaaS, a simple app</li>
<li>IT applications are siloed, but in the cloud applications can talk
to one another</li>
<li><p>IT was about taking care of the technology</p>
<ul>
<li>Now we are concerned with managing technology</li>
<li>In the nineties, we had people thinking that PCs would replace
IT</li>
<li>But in the end, companies still need experts, but a different
kind of expert.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>We need to be organized not around the technology, but around the
services we provide</p>
</li>
</ul>
<a class="anchor" id="strategize"></a>
<h2>Strategize</h2>
<p>Don&#39;t react to problems, first create a plan and then implement it.
Virtualization and the cloud won&#39;t solve a lot of problems.</p>
<ul>
<li>Inventory your services.</li>
<li>Find places where you can succeed</li>
<li>Start small</li>
<li>Examine how things we run on the cloud versus run on a virtual
machine or private cloud.</li>
<li>Ultimately the cloud is just a computer in a new place</li>
</ul>
