		<h2>Thinking about the Cloud</h2>

		<p>The cloud consists of hardware and software resources accessed over 
		the Internet. These scalable resources are provided as metered services 
		such as applications, development platforms, storage, or even an entire 
		OS. More formally, these services are designated as follows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Application running in the cloud: Software as a Service (SaaS)</li>
			<li>Development platforms: Platform as a Service (PaaS)</li>
			<li>An OS in the cloud: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We do not need to know where, or exactly how, the cloud is 
		configured. In general, however, the cloud consists of a series of huge 
		data centers.&nbsp; Each data center will host thousands of relatively 
		inexpensive physical machines. Each physical machine will host multiple 
		virtual machines. Typically these data centers are owned by huge 
		corporations such as Microsoft, Google, or Amazon.</p>
		<p>Cloud computing is not a new technology, rather it is an evolutionary 
		step in a continuing process.&nbsp;The word cloud is an abstraction standing like a shroud 
		in front of a lot of real world technologies. Much of the work we do in the 
		cloud revolves around our understanding of how those big abstractions 
		apply to specific 
		technologies. </p>

		<p>When first approaching the cloud it can be helpful tend to focus on three main themes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Working with Virtual Machines</li>
			<li>Working with Software as a Service (SaaS) applications that run 
			in the cloud. Examples include WordPress, MediaWiki and PhpMyAdmin.</li>
			<li>Working with code to create sites and applications that run in 
			the cloud. </li>
		</ul>

		<p>The code we write exists on the both the client and the server. It ranges from:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Client side HTML pages or web applications typically writting 
			using HTML5, 
			CSS3 and JavaScript.</li>
			<li>Server side code for running web 
			services which are typically written using various scripting 
			languages such as Python, PHP or node.js</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Here are some practical examples of things I do to gain experience with 
		the cloud:&nbsp;</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Beg, borrow or buy cloud machines, services or software run by some 
			third party.</li>
			<li>Configure a base machine with Windows or Linux installed directly 
			on the metal so that it runs the tools that like web servers that host 
			cloud applications</li>
			<li>Configure virtual machines that host Linux or Windows</li>
			<li>In these virtual machines, I install SaaS applications like MediaWiki, 
			PhpMyAdmin and WordPress</li>
			<li>Learn to use MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server</li>
			<li>Learn to use and configure IIS and Apache</li>
			<li>Lean how to configure Linux and Windows to host an array of cloud 
			and network based tools and scripting languages such as SSH, SFTP, PHP, 
			XML and Python.</li>
			<li>Write PHP and Python scripts that access MySQL or other data stores</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The more we work with these technology the more employable we are, the 
		more we are able to tap into the power of the cloud, and the more fun we 
		have.</p>

		<p>It is hard to laud any one technology as the most important. Many different 
		cloud based pursuits are valuable. For instance, if we use third party cloud 
		tools, we gain experience that can help us:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Learn to use important tools such SSH so that we can configure and 
			explore remote servers </li>
			<li>Learn how to use SFTP to move files between a local and remote machine 
			is a valuable experience. (Good tools for SFTP include Filezilla and 
			Beyond Compare)</li>
			<li>In some cases you will get a chance to manage databases remotely 
			with tools like PhpMyAdmin</li>
			<li>You can provide yourself with a valuable tool that lets you easily 
			access your files from multiple locations without having to copy them 
			back and forth. As long as you are on the Internet, you can access the 
			files you put on a third party server.</li>
			<li>You will learn a little about pricing structures, and you may even 
			about how to buy and set up a domain name</li>
		</ul>

		<p>In general you will gain valuable experience working in one important 
		part of the cloud, so by all means, please pursue this idea.</p>

		<p>Sometimes, however, we gain even more experience just working on our 
		home machines without ever venturing into the bigger cloud. For instance, 
		we set up virtual machines that help us: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>

			<p>Understand how third party sites are designed and configured. This 
			can help us better leverage the tools we access on the cloud and it 
			can give us the skills we need to be employed by the companies that 
			run cloud sites.</p>
			</li>
			<li>

			<p>The more we know about virtual machines, the more employable we are, 
			and the more capable we are of understanding and using today's complex 
			computer systems. A company that plans to rent sites that come with 
			WordPress or similar tools installed doesn't need to hire anyone to 
			perform those tasks. In other words, there are no jobs in that world. 
			The people who are hiring are sites that want to hire developers to 
			set up WordPress or MediaWiki so their users can access them. In other 
			words, you want to work for a company that creates sites in the cloud, 
			you don't want to just be their customer. If you can also answer yes 
			to questions like: "Can you write a PHP script to access a database 
			that runs on a virtual machine" then you are all the more employable.</p>
			</li>
			<li>

			<p>It is important to know that sites like WordPress.com, as opposed 
			to WordPress.org, exist. The first provides for free instances of WordPress 
			that people can use. The other lets you install your own instances of 
			WordPress on any arbitrary machine. If you are using WordPress.com, 
			however, and you want to access the full power of WordPress, you have 
			to pay them money. Not all sites are run that way, but many are. If 
			you install your own instance of WordPress, then you have complete control 
			from the start, especially if you have run the install a few times and 
			feel comfortable configuring it.</p>
			</li>
			<li>

			<p>Whether you rent a site with WordPress installed, or work to help 
			a company set up such sites, in both cases you need to understand how 
			the technology works. It is the only way to really know what a technology 
			can and cannot do. There are some people in a bureaucracy who can get 
			away with just saying "let's use WordPress," but if they hope to get 
			ahead, they have to have the sense to find someone who understands that 
			technology in order to pick the right option for them and implement 
			the plan. I'm interested in being the one who knows how to use the tools 
			and knows how they work. Ultimately, the day will come when know one 
			will want to hire a manager who does not also understand the technology.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Virtual machines are useful for several reasons. Here are a few:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>They allow us to experiment. We can try out various programs and 
			technologies, and if we decide we don't like the technology, or that 
			we need to start over on the install, then we can easily roll back to 
			the earlier version and start again.</li>
			<li>They allow us to move code from one location (home) to another (school, 
			work) without having to install software twice and configure two computers 
			to do more or less the same thing.</li>
			<li>They allow us to set up "virtual" networks that simulate (or in 
			many cases exactly duplicate) real world computer interactions.</li>
			<li>They allow us to emulate hardware that we can't access, such as 
			an Android device.</li>
			<li>They can act as staging sites for our live sites </li>
			<li>As a variation on point one: They allow us to keep our base machine 
			"clean", while installing layers of software on virtual machines. That 
			way we don't have to go through a lengthy install on a real piece of 
			hardware nearly as often, while still getting the chance to experiment 
			with a wide variety of tools.</li>
			<li>They let us try out operating systems that we might not otherwise 
			get a chance to access. For instance, it is easy to install Linux or 
			Android on a virtual machine and experiment with these environments. 
			It is a much more radical step to try to dual boot our main machine 
			into both Linux and Windows, or to go out and buy an Android phone. 
			Both techniques work, but one is much easier than the other, particularly 
			if you want to experiment with multiple flavors of Linux or Android.</li>
