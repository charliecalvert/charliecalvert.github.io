<p>Git is a free, open source version control system. It allows you to track the different 
versions of code that you produce. You can roll time back, finding old versions of
your code, and you can compare one version with another version.</p>
<p>Version control has been around a long time. What makes Git different is the way
it handles repositories. Git has a distributed model that allows you to clone repositories 
onto your local machine. In the past, there was only version of the repository, typically
somewhere on your local internet. Git is quite different, in that you can have multiple
versions of your repository. This means  you can have a local version of the repository 
and check in and check out from there before deciding that you want to push to the<br>main repository.</p>
<p>Git is a sophisticated tool, and it is not easy to learn. It is however, the dominant
tool of its kind, and with good reason. It is powerful, flexible, and robust. Ultimately,
Git is worth mastering. In fact, much of the basic functionality of Git is relatively
easy to master once you understand how it works.</p>
<h2 id="centers">Centers of Activity</h2>
<p>Below you find links to the main site for Git. You will also find their
download page and related links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://git-scm.com/">http://git-scm.com/</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">http://git-scm.com/downloads</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>There are many Git servers in the cloud. Here are two that everyone should know
about:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com</a> </li>
<li>BitBucket: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">https://bitbucket.org/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You probably want to have accounts on both GitHub and BitBucket. Everyone uses
GitHub, and bitbucket competes by allowing you to have free private accounts.</p>

<h2 id="git-versus">Git vs DropBox</h2>
<p>There are some tools such as DropBox, GoogleDrive and OneDrive that will automatically propagate changes to any machine that subscribes to updates. Git, on the other hand, is designed to let developers, or authors, work on a set of documents and then share them when and as needed. The advantages to the second scenario (git), for a certain type of activity, are two fold:</p>
<ul>
<li>No changes are seen until the author is ready to share them. We can work on a rough draft, or on an algorithm, until it is polished, and then share it. If code were propagated automatically as we made changes, we would likely &quot;break the build&quot; for other developers. Our half finished code would appear on others machines as we worked on it. Results of sharing half finished code could be errors in the compilation process (npm start fails to work), or unexpected bugs in working code. A related scenario, perhaps a bit closer to home, would be a student who does not want to share their work with their teacher until it is complete. Or conversely, wants to share it before it is complete in order to ask a question, but does not want to share just any version, but rather a particular version. If changes were propagated automatically, the student could not work on their code until the teacher had reviewed it.</li>
<li>From the other side, a developer might not want to see another person&#39;s changes until they are ready for them. Even if the code that was automatically propagated to their machine did work correctly, it can be disconcerting to have to program against services, objects and APIs that change without warning. </li>
</ul>
<p>I think all that goes at least some of the way to explaining why Git works the way it does.</p>
<p>Sharing documents is a good and common use of a tool like Git. When working with documents rather than code, the consequences of automatically pushing updates is less severe, but still real. Suppose I&#39;m putting together a list of steps that must be followed. If I accidentally leave out a few steps in my first draft, then people who are following my changes live are likely to be miffed that my guide does not work. Or perhaps we begin working on a description of a seven step process. We get to step 5, then get called to dinner, or head off to bed. People reading the document would then begin following my steps, only to find that the description is incomplete.</p>
<p>There are, of course, strong arguments for exactly the opposite kind of functionality. If I&#39;m taking notes on a lecture in Evernote, at the end of class I want them to be propagated automatically and immediately so I can access them as needed from home. There is no advantage in that scenario to any other system. Leaving a copy of my notes at school without being able to access them from home would have no advantages. I want to see all changes immediately on all machines where I log into Evernote.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that there are many different ways to share information in the cloud. The only way to learn which one is best for which task is to learn the tools, and begin experimenting with them. Everyone is working these things out for themselves just now. Unfortunately, students in the future will probably be told to use tool X for purpose Y, and tool W for Z. Neat and clean, but not nearly as fun as exploring this world on your own. We live in interesting times.</p>
<h2 id="install-git-on-windows">Install Git on Windows</h2>
<p>There are two applications you might want to install. The primary GIT application
is found here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://git-scm.com/">http://git-scm.com/</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">http://git-scm.com/downloads</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>When you run the install shown above, be sure to choose the option that gets GIT
on your path. Also, you will probably want to set GIT up to work with PLink 
(Putty), and you will want to choose an option that ensures that you have LF 
style line endings on files that you plan to use on a Linux box.</p>
<p>Because GitHub is so ubiquitous, you will probably want to install it&#39;s GUI 
front end also:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>You can use Git-Scm with Git-Hub, but there is no denying that the GitHub GUI 
makes dealing with repositories on GitHub very easy.</p>
<h2 id="clone-on-desktop">Clone on Desktop</h2>
<p>On GitHub, you might notice a button that says <strong>Clone on Desktop</strong>. 
If set up correctly, this button will allow you to clone a repository
using a GUI application. On Windows, this application is called <strong>GitHub
for Windows</strong>. For a variety of reasons, I think it is ultimately 
best to manage your Git repositories from the command line, but there
is no denying that this GUI interface can be useful, particularly
if you only plan to use GIT from Windows.</p>
<p>In theory, you should be able to just push the <strong>Clone on Desktop</strong> 
button and the process of installing <strong>GitHub for Windows</strong> should 
occur automatically. In practice, this does not always happen. 
Unfortunately, there are variety of reasons why this call might 
fail, depending on the browser and system you are using. My 
suggestion is to simply install <strong>GitHub for Windows</strong> manually, and 
then the button should begin working as you expect.</p>
<p>To install <strong>GitHub for Windows</strong> go to the first link below and 
push the big green button:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git">GitHub for Windows Link</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github-windows.s3.amazonaws.com/GitHubSetup.exe">Direct link to GitHub for Windows download</a></li>
<li><a href="https://help.github.com/">GitHub Help pages</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A file called <strong>GitHubSetup.exe</strong> should soon be downloaded to your
downloads folder. You can run it from there. The install is a forehead
install, and should be navigable by everyone in your family from your
cat on up. I believe that it does not require admin privileges to run
this install.</p>
<p>While you are at it, and if you have not already done so, you should
also install git:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">Install GIT itself</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="configuring-git">Configuring GIT</h2>
<p>I describe how to use GitGui below. If you are working from the command line, go to your home directory and open <strong>.gitconfig</strong>. You may prefer to just view this file, and use the commands
mentioned below to edit it. Or, you could edit it directly. The changes that need to be made
are fairly obvious.</p>
<p>My .gitconfig looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>[user]
email = someone@somewhere.com
name = Charlie CedarIsle Calvert
[push]
default = simple
[gui]
recentrepo = C:/Src/Git/Simple02
recentrepo = C:/Src/Git/Writing
recentrepo = C:/Src/Git/CloudNotes
recentrepo = C:/Src/Git/JsObjects
</code></pre><p>As you can see, I&#39;ve set up the <strong>email</strong>, <strong>name</strong> and <strong>push | default</strong> options.
If you don&#39;t set up your user name and email as described above,
you may see this message at some point:</p>
<pre><code>Your name and email address were configured automatically based
on your username and hostname. Please check that they are accurate.
You can suppress this message by setting them explicitly:

    git config --global user.name &quot;Your Name&quot;
    git config --global user.email you@example.com

After doing this, you may fix the identity used for this commit with:

    git commit --amend --reset-author
</code></pre><p>To resolve this message, just follow the instructions. For instance, you could type
something like the following:</p>
<pre><code>    git config --global user.name &quot;Charlie Calvert on EC2&quot;
    git config --global user.email charlie@example.com
</code></pre><p>When you do this, you are changing the settings in your <strong>~/.gitconfig</strong> file.</p>
<p>If you type the last suggested command, the one about amending your commit,
you may end up in an editor such as <strong>nano</strong> or <strong>vim</strong>. If you can 
handle that, then go ahead and do it, otherwise, you can relatively safely skip
that step. All that will be missing is the name of the committer in your repository
for this particular commit. Later commits will have your name.</p>
<p>You may also see a message like this:</p>
<pre><code>warning: push.default is unset; its implicit value is changing in
Git 2.0 from &#39;matching&#39; to &#39;simple&#39;. To squelch this message
and maintain the current behavior after the default changes, use:

  git config --global push.default matching

To squelch this message and adopt the new behavior now, use:

  git config --global push.default simple
</code></pre><p>I respond to this message by typing the following:</p>
<pre><code>git config --global push.default simple
</code></pre><p>For those who are interested, let&#39;s leave the command line and discuss GitGui. 
When you first open GitGui, you should set up your user name and 
email. From the menu, select <strong>Edit | Options</strong>.</p>
<p>What you write in the GitGui options ends up in the email and name 
fields of <strong>.gitconfig</strong>, and vice-versa. It is important to have both 
of these fields filled out from the start. </p>
<p>If you change the information for a particular repository in GitGui 
so that it differs from your global values, then that information 
will appear in the config file from your repository. If it is the 
same as the global values, the same as the values .gitconfig, then 
it will not appear in the config file for your repository.</p>
<p>There is a third option beyond what is mentioned above. You can look at 
the <strong>.git/config</strong> file from a particular repository. Remember that <strong>.git</strong> 
directory is hidden on both Windows and Linux. I usually only open config file
if I want to change the URL for a repository, but you can do more in there
if you want. For now, I&#39;ll leave those options up to you to explore.</p>
