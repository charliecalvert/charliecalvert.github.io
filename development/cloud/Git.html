<p>Git is a free, open source version control system. It allows you to track the different 
versions of code that you produce. You can roll time back, finding old versions of
your code, and you can compare one version with another version.</p>
<p>Version control has been around a long time. What makes Git different is the way
it handles repositories. Git has a distributed model that allows you to clone repositories 
onto your local machine. In the past, there was only version of the repository, typically
somewhere on your local internet. Git is quite different, in that you can have multiple
versions of your repository. This means  you can have a local version of the repository 
and check in and check out from there before deciding that you want to push to the<br>main repository.</p>
<p>Git is a sophisticated tool, and it is not easy to learn. It is however, the dominant
tool of its kind, and with good reason. It is powerful, flexible, and robust. Ultimately,
Git is worth mastering. In fact, much of the basic functionality of Git is relatively
easy to master once you understand how it works.</p>
<h2 id="centers">Centers of Activity</h2>
<p>Below you find links to the main site for Git. You will also find their
download page and related links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://git-scm.com/">http://git-scm.com/</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">http://git-scm.com/downloads</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>There are many Git servers in the cloud. Here are two that everyone should know
about:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com</a> </li>
<li>BitBucket: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">https://bitbucket.org/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You probably want to have accounts on both GitHub and BitBucket. Everyone uses
GitHub, and bitbucket competes by allowing you to have free private accounts.</p>

<h2 id="git-versus">Git vs DropBox</h2>
<p>There are some tools such as DropBox, GoogleDrive and OneDrive that will automatically propagate changes to any machine that subscribes to updates. Git, on the other hand, is designed to let developers, or authors, work on a set of documents and then share them when and as needed. The advantages to the second scenario (git), for a certain type of activity, are two fold:</p>
<ul>
<li>No changes are seen until the author is ready to share them. We can work on a rough draft, or on an algorithm, until it is polished, and then share it. If code were propagated automatically as we made changes, we would likely &quot;break the build&quot; for other developers. Our half finished code would appear on others machines as we worked on it. Results of sharing half finished code could be errors in the compilation process (npm start fails to work), or unexpected bugs in working code. A related scenario, perhaps a bit closer to home, would be a student who does not want to share their work with their teacher until it is complete. Or conversely, wants to share it before it is complete in order to ask a question, but does not want to share just any version, but rather a particular version. If changes were propagated automatically, the student could not work on their code until the teacher had reviewed it.</li>
<li>From the other side, a developer might not want to see another person&#39;s changes until they are ready for them. Even if the code that was automatically propagated to their machine did work correctly, it can be disconcerting to have to program against services, objects and APIs that change without warning. </li>
</ul>
