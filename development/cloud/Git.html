<p>Git is a free, open source version control system. It allows you to track the different 
versions of code that you produce. You can roll time back, finding old versions of
your code, and you can compare one version with another version.</p>
<p>Version control has been around a long time. What makes Git different is the way
it handles repositories. Git has a distributed model that allows you to clone repositories 
onto your local machine. In the past, there was only version of the repository, typically
somewhere on your local internet. Git is quite different, in that you can have multiple
versions of your repository. This means  you can have a local version of the repository 
and check in and check out from there before deciding that you want to push to the<br>main repository.</p>
<p>Git is a sophisticated tool, and it is not easy to learn. It is however, the dominant
tool of its kind, and with good reason. It is powerful, flexible, and robust. Ultimately,
Git is worth mastering. In fact, much of the basic functionality of Git is relatively
easy to master once you understand how it works.</p>
<h2 id="centers">Centers of Activity</h2>
<p>Below you find links to the main site for Git. You will also find their
download page and related links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://git-scm.com/">http://git-scm.com/</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">http://git-scm.com/downloads</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>There are many Git servers in the cloud. Here are two that everyone should know
about:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com</a> </li>
<li>BitBucket: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">https://bitbucket.org/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You probably want to have accounts on both GitHub and BitBucket. Everyone uses
GitHub, and bitbucket competes by allowing you to have free private accounts.</p>
<h2 id="install-git-on-windows">Install Git on Windows</h2>
<p>There are two applications you might want to install. The primary GIT application
is found here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://git-scm.com/">http://git-scm.com/</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">http://git-scm.com/downloads</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>When you run the install shown above, be sure to choose the option that gets GIT
on your path. Also, you will probably want to set GIT up to work with PLink 
(Putty), and you will want to choose an option that ensures that you have LF 
style line endings on files that you plan to use on a Linux box.</p>
<p>Because GitHub is so ubiquitous, you will probably want to install it&#39;s GUI 
front end also:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>You can use Git-Scm with Git-Hub, but there is no denying that the GitHub GUI 
makes dealing with repositories on GitHub very easy.</p>
<h2 id="clone-on-desktop">Clone on Desktop</h2>
<p>On GitHub, you might notice a button that says <strong>Clone on Desktop</strong>. 
If set up correctly, this button will allow you to clone a repository
using a GUI application. On Windows, this application is called <strong>GitHub
for Windows</strong>. For a variety of reasons, I think it is ultimately 
best to manage your Git repositories from the command line, but there
is no denying that this GUI interface can be useful, particularly
if you only plan to use GIT from Windows.</p>
<p>In theory, you should be able to just push the <strong>Clone on Desktop</strong> 
button and the process of installing <strong>GitHub for Windows</strong> should 
occur automatically. In practice, this does not always happen. 
Unfortunately, there are variety of reasons why this call might 
fail, depending on the browser and system you are using. My 
suggestion is to simply install <strong>GitHub for Windows</strong> manually, and 
then the button should begin working as you expect.</p>
<p>To install <strong>GitHub for Windows</strong> go to the first link below and 
push the big green button:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git">GitHub for Windows Link</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github-windows.s3.amazonaws.com/GitHubSetup.exe">Direct link to GitHub for Windows download</a></li>
<li><a href="https://help.github.com/">GitHub Help pages</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A file called <strong>GitHubSetup.exe</strong> should soon be downloaded to your
downloads folder. You can run it from there. The install is a forehead
install, and should be navigable by everyone in your family from your
cat on up. I believe that it does not require admin privileges to run
this install.</p>
<p>While you are at it, and if you have not already done so, you should
also install git:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">Install GIT itself</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="configuring-git">Configuring GIT</h2>
<p>I describe how to use GitGui below. If you are working from the command line, go to your home directory and open <strong>.gitconfig</strong>. You may prefer to just view this file, and use the commands
mentioned below to edit it. Or, you could edit it directly. The changes that need to be made
are fairly obvious.</p>
<p>My .gitconfig looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>[user]
email = someone@somewhere.com
name = Charlie CedarIsle Calvert
[push]
default = simple
[gui]
recentrepo = C:/Src/Git/Simple02
recentrepo = C:/Src/Git/Writing
recentrepo = C:/Src/Git/CloudNotes
recentrepo = C:/Src/Git/JsObjects
</code></pre><p>As you can see, I&#39;ve set up the <strong>email</strong>, <strong>name</strong> and <strong>push | default</strong> options.
If you don&#39;t set up your user name and email as described above,
you may see this message at some point:</p>
<pre><code>Your name and email address were configured automatically based
on your username and hostname. Please check that they are accurate.
You can suppress this message by setting them explicitly:

    git config --global user.name &quot;Your Name&quot;
    git config --global user.email you@example.com

After doing this, you may fix the identity used for this commit with:

    git commit --amend --reset-author
</code></pre><p>To resolve this message, just follow the instructions. For instance, you could type
something like the following:</p>
<pre><code>    git config --global user.name &quot;Charlie Calvert on EC2&quot;
    git config --global user.email charlie@example.com
</code></pre><p>When you do this, you are changing the settings in your <strong>~/.gitconfig</strong> file.</p>
<p>If you type the last suggested command, the one about amending your commit,
you may end up in an editor such as <strong>nano</strong> or <strong>vim</strong>. If you can 
handle that, then go ahead and do it, otherwise, you can relatively safely skip
that step. All that will be missing is the name of the committer in your repository
for this particular commit. Later commits will have your name.</p>
<p>You may also see a message like this:</p>
<pre><code>warning: push.default is unset; its implicit value is changing in
Git 2.0 from &#39;matching&#39; to &#39;simple&#39;. To squelch this message
and maintain the current behavior after the default changes, use:

  git config --global push.default matching

To squelch this message and adopt the new behavior now, use:

  git config --global push.default simple
</code></pre><p>I respond to this message by typing the following:</p>
<pre><code>git config --global push.default simple
</code></pre><p>For those who are interested, let&#39;s leave the command line and discuss GitGui. 
When you first open GitGui, you should set up your user name and 
email. From the menu, select <strong>Edit | Options</strong>.</p>
<p>What you write in the GitGui options ends up in the email and name 
fields of <strong>.gitconfig</strong>, and vice-versa. It is important to have both 
of these fields filled out from the start. </p>
<p>If you change the information for a particular repository in GitGui 
so that it differs from your global values, then that information 
will appear in the config file from your repository. If it is the 
same as the global values, the same as the values .gitconfig, then 
it will not appear in the config file for your repository.</p>
<p>There is a third option beyond what is mentioned above. You can look at 
the <strong>.git/config</strong> file from a particular repository. Remember that <strong>.git</strong> 
directory is hidden on both Windows and Linux. I usually only open config file
if I want to change the URL for a repository, but you can do more in there
if you want. For now, I&#39;ll leave those options up to you to explore.</p>
<h2 id="running-git">Running GIT</h2>
<p>If you use Putty, it will probably be simplest for you if you use GIT with 
plink, which is part of Putty. During the GIT SCM install, you have the 
chance to set this up, as shown in the screenshot below:</p>
<p><img src="http://elvenware.com/charlie/development/cloud/images/GitScm01.png" alt="Use plink"></p>
<p>If you have already installed GIT, don&#39;t despair! All the option above does is 
set an environment variable named GIT_SSH. If you chose the option shown in the
screenshot, then when you type SET at the command line, you should find something
like the following value for GIT_SSH: </p>
<pre><code>GIT_SSH=C:\Program Files (x86)\PuTTY\plink.exe
</code></pre><p>Since you have a deep knowledge of envirnment variables, you know how to modify
this variable using the Environment Variables dialog.</p>
<p><img src="http://elvenware.com/charlie/development/cloud/images/GitScm02.png" alt="Set the GIT_SSH environment variable"></p>
<p>Here is an example of how to configure the variable:</p>
<p><img src="http://elvenware.com/charlie/development/cloud/images/Git07.png" alt="Set the GIT_SSH environment variable"></p>
<p>If you have been living a sheltered life, you can learn about about 
environment variables here:</p>

elsewhere in this document.</p>
