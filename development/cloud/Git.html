<p>Git is a free, open source version control system. It allows you to track the different 
versions of code that you produce. You can roll time back, finding old versions of
your code, and you can compare one version with another version.</p>
<p>Version control has been around a long time. What makes Git different is the way
it handles repositories. Git has a distributed model that allows you to clone repositories 
onto your local machine. In the past, there was only version of the repository, typically
somewhere on your local internet. Git is quite different, in that you can have multiple
versions of your repository. This means  you can have a local version of the repository 
and check in and check out from there before deciding that you want to push to the<br>main repository.</p>
<p>Git is a sophisticated tool, and it is not easy to learn. It is however, the dominant
tool of its kind, and with good reason. It is powerful, flexible, and robust. Ultimately,
Git is worth mastering. In fact, much of the basic functionality of Git is relatively
easy to master once you understand how it works.</p>
<h2 id="centers">Centers of Activity</h2>
<p>Below you find links to the main site for Git. You will also find their
download page and related links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://git-scm.com/">http://git-scm.com/</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">http://git-scm.com/downloads</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>There are many Git servers in the cloud. Here are two that everyone should know
about:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com</a> </li>
<li>BitBucket: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">https://bitbucket.org/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You probably want to have accounts on both GitHub and BitBucket. Everyone uses
GitHub, and bitbucket competes by allowing you to have free private accounts.</p>
<h2 id="git-guides-found-on-the-web">GIT Guides found on the Web</h2>
<p>A video I put together:</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="git-versus">Git vs DropBox</h2>
<p>There are some tools such as DropBox, GoogleDrive and OneDrive that will automatically propagate changes to any machine that subscribes to updates. Git, on the other hand, is designed to let developers, or authors, work on a set of documents and then share them when and as needed. The advantages to the second scenario (git), for a certain type of activity, are two fold:</p>
<ul>
<li>No changes are seen until the author is ready to share them. We can work on a rough draft, or on an algorithm, until it is polished, and then share it. If code were propagated automatically as we made changes, we would likely &quot;break the build&quot; for other developers. Our half finished code would appear on others machines as we worked on it. Results of sharing half finished code could be errors in the compilation process (npm start fails to work), or unexpected bugs in working code. A related scenario, perhaps a bit closer to home, would be a student who does not want to share their work with their teacher until it is complete. Or conversely, wants to share it before it is complete in order to ask a question, but does not want to share just any version, but rather a particular version. If changes were propagated automatically, the student could not work on their code until the teacher had reviewed it.</li>
<li>From the other side, a developer might not want to see another person&#39;s changes until they are ready for them. Even if the code that was automatically propagated to their machine did work correctly, it can be disconcerting to have to program against services, objects and APIs that change without warning. </li>
</ul>
<p>I think all that goes at least some of the way to explaining why Git works the way it does.</p>
<p>Sharing documents is a good and common use of a tool like Git. When working with documents rather than code, the consequences of automatically pushing updates is less severe, but still real. Suppose I&#39;m putting together a list of steps that must be followed. If I accidentally leave out a few steps in my first draft, then people who are following my changes live are likely to be miffed that my guide does not work. Or perhaps we begin working on a description of a seven step process. We get to step 5, then get called to dinner, or head off to bed. People reading the document would then begin following my steps, only to find that the description is incomplete.</p>
<p>There are, of course, strong arguments for exactly the opposite kind of functionality. If I&#39;m taking notes on a lecture in Evernote, at the end of class I want them to be propagated automatically and immediately so I can access them as needed from home. There is no advantage in that scenario to any other system. Leaving a copy of my notes at school without being able to access them from home would have no advantages. I want to see all changes immediately on all machines where I log into Evernote.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that there are many different ways to share information in the cloud. The only way to learn which one is best for which task is to learn the tools, and begin experimenting with them. Everyone is working these things out for themselves just now. Unfortunately, students in the future will probably be told to use tool X for purpose Y, and tool W for Z. Neat and clean, but not nearly as fun as exploring this world on your own. We live in interesting times.</p>
<h2 id="install-git-on-windows">Install Git on Windows</h2>
<p>There are two applications you might want to install. The primary GIT application
is found here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://git-scm.com/">http://git-scm.com/</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">http://git-scm.com/downloads</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>When you run the install shown above, be sure to choose the option that gets GIT
on your path. Also, you will probably want to set GIT up to work with PLink 
(Putty), and you will want to choose an option that ensures that you have LF 
style line endings on files that you plan to use on a Linux box.</p>
<p>Because GitHub is so ubiquitous, you will probably want to install it&#39;s GUI 
front end also:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>You can use Git-Scm with Git-Hub, but there is no denying that the GitHub GUI 
makes dealing with repositories on GitHub very easy.</p>
<h2 id="clone-on-desktop">Clone on Desktop</h2>
<p>On GitHub, you might notice a button that says <strong>Clone on Desktop</strong>. 
If set up correctly, this button will allow you to clone a repository
using a GUI application. On Windows, this application is called <strong>GitHub
for Windows</strong>. For a variety of reasons, I think it is ultimately 
best to manage your Git repositories from the command line, but there
is no denying that this GUI interface can be useful, particularly
if you only plan to use GIT from Windows.</p>
<p>In theory, you should be able to just push the <strong>Clone on Desktop</strong> 
button and the process of installing <strong>GitHub for Windows</strong> should 
occur automatically. In practice, this does not always happen. 
Unfortunately, there are variety of reasons why this call might 
fail, depending on the browser and system you are using. My 
suggestion is to simply install <strong>GitHub for Windows</strong> manually, and 
then the button should begin working as you expect.</p>
<p>To install <strong>GitHub for Windows</strong> go to the first link below and 
push the big green button:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git">GitHub for Windows Link</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github-windows.s3.amazonaws.com/GitHubSetup.exe">Direct link to GitHub for Windows download</a></li>
<li><a href="https://help.github.com/">GitHub Help pages</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A file called <strong>GitHubSetup.exe</strong> should soon be downloaded to your
downloads folder. You can run it from there. The install is a forehead
install, and should be navigable by everyone in your family from your
cat on up. I believe that it does not require admin privileges to run
this install.</p>
<p>While you are at it, and if you have not already done so, you should
also install git:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">Install GIT itself</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="configuring-git">Configuring GIT</h2>
<p>I describe how to use GitGui below. If you are working from the command line, go to your home directory and open <strong>.gitconfig</strong>. You may prefer to just view this file, and use the commands
mentioned below to edit it. Or, you could edit it directly. The changes that need to be made
are fairly obvious.</p>
<p>My .gitconfig looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>[user]
email = someone@somewhere.com
name = Charlie CedarIsle Calvert
[push]
default = simple
[gui]
recentrepo = C:/Src/Git/Simple02
recentrepo = C:/Src/Git/Writing
recentrepo = C:/Src/Git/CloudNotes
recentrepo = C:/Src/Git/JsObjects
</code></pre><p>As you can see, I&#39;ve set up the <strong>email</strong>, <strong>name</strong> and <strong>push | default</strong> options.
If you don&#39;t set up your user name and email as described above,
you may see this message at some point:</p>
<pre><code>Your name and email address were configured automatically based
on your username and hostname. Please check that they are accurate.
You can suppress this message by setting them explicitly:

    git config --global user.name &quot;Your Name&quot;
    git config --global user.email you@example.com

After doing this, you may fix the identity used for this commit with:

    git commit --amend --reset-author
</code></pre><p>To resolve this message, just follow the instructions. For instance, you could type
something like the following:</p>
<pre><code>    git config --global user.name &quot;Charlie Calvert on EC2&quot;
    git config --global user.email charlie@example.com
</code></pre><p>When you do this, you are changing the settings in your <strong>~/.gitconfig</strong> file.</p>
<p>If you type the last suggested command, the one about amending your commit,
you may end up in an editor such as <strong>nano</strong> or <strong>vim</strong>. If you can 
handle that, then go ahead and do it, otherwise, you can relatively safely skip
that step. All that will be missing is the name of the committer in your repository
for this particular commit. Later commits will have your name.</p>
<p>You may also see a message like this:</p>
<pre><code>warning: push.default is unset; its implicit value is changing in
Git 2.0 from &#39;matching&#39; to &#39;simple&#39;. To squelch this message
and maintain the current behavior after the default changes, use:

  git config --global push.default matching

To squelch this message and adopt the new behavior now, use:

  git config --global push.default simple
</code></pre><p>I respond to this message by typing the following:</p>
<pre><code>git config --global push.default simple
</code></pre><p>For those who are interested, let&#39;s leave the command line and discuss GitGui. 
When you first open GitGui, you should set up your user name and 
email. From the menu, select <strong>Edit | Options</strong>.</p>
<p>What you write in the GitGui options ends up in the email and name 
fields of <strong>.gitconfig</strong>, and vice-versa. It is important to have both 
of these fields filled out from the start. </p>
<p>If you change the information for a particular repository in GitGui 
so that it differs from your global values, then that information 
will appear in the config file from your repository. If it is the 
same as the global values, the same as the values .gitconfig, then 
it will not appear in the config file for your repository.</p>
<p>There is a third option beyond what is mentioned above. You can look at 
the <strong>.git/config</strong> file from a particular repository. Remember that <strong>.git</strong> 
directory is hidden on both Windows and Linux. I usually only open config file
if I want to change the URL for a repository, but you can do more in there
if you want. For now, I&#39;ll leave those options up to you to explore.</p>
<h2 id="running-git">Running GIT</h2>
<p>If you use Putty, it will probably be simplest for you if you use GIT with 
plink, which is part of Putty. During the GIT SCM install, you have the 
chance to set this up, as shown in the screenshot below:</p>
<p><img src="http://elvenware.com/charlie/development/cloud/images/GitScm01.png" alt="Use plink"></p>
<p>If you have already installed GIT, don&#39;t despair! All the option above does is 
set an environment variable named GIT_SSH. If you chose the option shown in the
screenshot, then when you type SET at the command line, you should find something
like the following value for GIT_SSH: </p>
<pre><code>GIT_SSH=C:\Program Files (x86)\PuTTY\plink.exe
</code></pre><p>Since you have a deep knowledge of envirnment variables, you know how to modify
this variable using the Environment Variables dialog.</p>
<p><img src="http://elvenware.com/charlie/development/cloud/images/GitScm02.png" alt="Set the GIT_SSH environment variable"></p>
<p>Here is an example of how to configure the variable:</p>
<p><img src="http://elvenware.com/charlie/development/cloud/images/Git07.png" alt="Set the GIT_SSH environment variable"></p>
<p>If you have been living a sheltered life, you can learn about about 
environment variables here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/os/windows/faq.html#environment">http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/os/windows/faq.html#environment</a></p>
<p>A related issue is the &quot;Host Key is not Cached&quot; error, which is discussed 
elsewhere in this document.</p>
<h2 id="install-git-on-ubuntu-server">Install Git on Ubuntu Server</h2>
<p>It may be helpful to setup a default editor. You can do so by running either of 
the following at a *nix command prompt:</p>
<pre><code>export EDITOR=nano
export EDITOR=vim
</code></pre><p>Now install git:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install git
</code></pre><p>Create a directory named git and navigate to it:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir git
cd git
</code></pre><p>Now pull down a repository that you do not own, and hence will be in read only
mode:</p>
<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/charliecalvert/JsObjects.git
</code></pre><p>You can go to GitHub and create a repository and put a readme file in it. If you
own the repository, or have rights to it, then the command might look more like
this:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/charliecalvert/bc-basic.git
</code></pre><h2 id="git-gui-basics">Git GUI Basics</h2>
<p>First line for HTTPs clone:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/charliecalvert/JsObjects.git">https://github.com/charliecalvert/JsObjects.git</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Second line, say where you want it on your system:</p>
<ul>
<li>C:\Users\MyUserName\Documents\GitHub\JsObjects</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/development/cloud/images/GitGui04.png" alt="Clone Repository"></p>
<p>Do a pull with GitGui:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remote | Fetch From Origin</li>
<li>Merge | Local Merge</li>
</ul>
<p>The following images take you step by step through the process 
of committing changes to a repository. </p>
<ul>
<li>First we edit one or more files in our repository.</li>
<li>Open the repository in GitGui</li>
<li>Examine unstaged changes</li>
<li>Stage the changes</li>
<li>Compose a commit message </li>
<li>Commit the changes</li>
<li>Push</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/development/cloud/images/GitGui07.png" alt="Unstaged Changes"></p>
<p><img src="http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/development/cloud/images/GitGui08.png" alt="Ready to Commit"></p>
<p><img src="http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/development/cloud/images/GitGui05.png" alt="Get ready to Push "></p>
<p><img src="http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/development/cloud/images/GitGui06.png" alt="Push Success"></p>
<p>You can choose <strong>Repository | Visualize XXX History</strong> to get an overview
of what has been happening in the repository:</p>
<p><img src="images/GitHistory01.png" alt="Visualize History"></p>
<h2 id="git-help-command">Git Help Command</h2>
<p>To learn about a git command, type <strong>git help &lt;COMMAND&gt;</strong>. For instance:</p>
<pre><code>git help status
git help commit
git help add
</code></pre><p>In some cases the results will be displayed at the command line. In others, you will be taken to a web page.</p>
<h2 id="the-git-status-command">The Git Status Command</h2>
<p>Suppose you have a file called users.html that you have edited. Here is how to 
confirm that you have edited the file, and to see if there are other files
you may have edited, added, or deleted from or to the repository:</p>
<pre><code>git status
</code></pre><p>I issue the git status command frequently. It lets me know the state of my
repository. Here for instance, is what you will see if you issue the git
status command after first creating users.html:</p>
<pre><code>C:\Git\foo&gt; echo foo &gt; users.html
G:\Src\Git\foo&gt; git status
# On branch master
# Untracked files:
#   (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)
#
#       users.html
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use &quot;git add&quot; to track)
</code></pre><p>When we typed <strong>git status</strong>, git replied by telling us the status of the 
files in your directory. In particular, git is telling us that we have a new 
file in our repository called <strong>users.html</strong>. When git sees a new file or 
directory in a repository, then the status message is usually &quot;Untracked 
files.&quot; This is git&#39;s way of saying &quot;I see this new file or directory in 
your repository, and I&#39;m not currently tracking it.&quot; Then it adds a hint: 
&quot;(use &quot;git add <file>...&quot; to include in what will be committed).&quot; It is 
telling you that you can use the command <strong>git add users.html</strong> to start 
tracking the folder that is currently not being tracked. There are several 
variants on the git add command that you can run. For instance, typing <strong>git 
add .</strong> (that&#39;s git plus add plus a period) will usually add any untracked or 
modified files to the repository without you having to spell them out.</p>
<h2 id="git-log">Git Log</h2>
<p>You can just type <strong>git log</strong>, but I find <strong>git log --pretty-oneline</strong> more useful. For instance:</p>
<pre><code>git log --pretty=oneline
7ff2d4b4d3dcea2d938a2a7e0ed42e1000cb32a2 Readme has Elvenware patterns document
e16107b10dce32d7abba9f973549222e5db7adf0 Clean up names for code readability
8739b8e3deee016ad5025f6764ef36ab571ff71c Add functional Programming examples
</code></pre><p>Now clone a particular commit:</p>
<pre><code>git branch functional 8739b8e3d
</code></pre><p>Now you can switch to the functional branch and see your files at the time of that commit.</p>
<pre><code>git checkout functional 
</code></pre><p>If you are tired of looking at that branch, you can switch back to the master branch and then permanently remove your <strong>functional</strong> branch:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout master
git branch --delete functional
</code></pre><p>You might also use with <strong>git diff</strong>. Like this:</p>
<pre><code>git diff e78fe3 a7e46a README.md
</code></pre><p>This compares the difference for a specific file between two commits. If you want to see the changes between all files in the two commits, just leave off the file name in the above command.</p>
<h2 id="git-show">Show History of a File</h2>
<p>First type <strong>git log <MyFile></strong> to see the times when you modified a file.
For instance, this shows the history of <strong>.gitignore</strong> in a repository:</p>
<pre><code>$ git log --oneline .gitignore
83925f1 updated .gitignore from a samed-name file
08e7f2b Adding Object Basics and SplitSlice
bd54f9f adding gitignore
</code></pre><p>Now show the contents of a particular version of the file with <strong>git show</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>$ git show 08e7f2:.gitignore
node_modules
.metadata
.idea
Thumbs.db
.c9
</code></pre><p>What we have done is type:</p>
<ul>
<li>git: Invoke Git</li>
<li>show: Invoke the show command</li>
<li>08e7f2: Reference a particular commit by giving enough of its ID to 
uniquely identify it. Six characters is usually enough, sometimes less.</li>
<li>:.gitignore. The type a colon and the file name.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another example, this time using the README file:</p>
<pre><code>$ git log --oneline README.md
01f3de2 Bar
2b593a3 asdf
f182b3c readme changed
ce4e0f2 README update
66f33ac initial Commit
</code></pre><p>Then view a particular version:</p>
<pre><code>$ git show f182b3c:README.md 
My Readme File
This is an update
New change after support for ssh
</code></pre><h2 id="git-files">Working with Files in a Repository</h2>
<p>Suppose you have a file called users.html that you have either recently 
created or recently edited. You now need to tell git to check in your 
changes, that is, to add your new or updated file to the repository. Whether 
the file is new or updated, here is how to check in the <strong>users.html</strong> file:</p>
<pre><code>git add users.html
git commit -m &quot;This is my message about the way I updated users.html&quot;
</code></pre><p>Now you have everything checked into your local copy of the Git repository. To
push these changes to your GitHub, BitBucket or other remote copy of the 
repository, issue this command:</p>
<pre><code>git push
</code></pre><p>Now, lets add a folder named temp and a file named foo.txt to the repository:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir temp  
cd temp
echo foo &gt; foo.txt
cd ..
</code></pre><p>The above commands create a new folder called <strong>temp</strong>. The second line 
shows how to navigate into the folder. The third line creates a new file 
called <strong>foo.txt</strong> with the contents being the single world <em>foo</em>. Finally 
we navigate back to the original directory where we were before we created 
the <strong>temp</strong> directory.</p>
<p>Now add the changes and commit the work to the repository:</p>
<pre><code>git add temp  
git commit -m &quot;adding temp&quot;  
</code></pre><p>After issuing the last command, you will see several lines of feedback from git. 
Now it is time to push your changes up to GitHub (or to wherever your 
repository is stored)L   </p>
<pre><code>git push  
</code></pre><p>If you do not have an SSH key and repository set up, you will now be asked for 
your username and password.     </p>
<p>Sometimes you will have conflicts between what is on the server and  what
you have on your machine. In that case, do a merge. This will  create a
local copy of you files with both sets of text in it. Open  your file in a
text editor, find the places where the conflicts  exist, fix them manually,
and then go through another  add/commit/push cycle.</p>
<h2 id="typical">A Typical Git Session</h2>
<p>Suppose you run git status and get this result:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;git status
# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use &quot;git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)
#
#       modified:   Cordova/CordovaInput/assets/www/index.html
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)
#
#       foobar.txt
</code></pre><p>Here you can see that one file, <strong>index.html</strong>, has been modified. Another file, called <strong>foobar.txt</strong>, has been created. To commit them both, do this:</p>
<pre><code>git add .
</code></pre><p>That&#39;s <strong>git add</strong> followed by a period. The period is a wild card saying: &quot;Add everything that has been changed.&quot; Now check your status:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;git status
# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use &quot;git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)
#
#       modified:   Cordova/CordovaInput/assets/www/index.html
#       new file:   foobar.txt
#
</code></pre><p>As you can see, there are now two files witing to be committed. You can commit them like this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;git commit -m &quot;Update index.html and add foobar.txt to to ward off polen smears.&quot;
[master c91d5fc] Update index.html to support tiger attacks, add foobar.txt to ward off polen smears.
 2 files changed, 2 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
 create mode 100644 foobar.txt
</code></pre><p>Now push them to the repository:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;git push

</code></pre><h2 id="the-gitignore-file">The GitIgnore File</h2>
<p>You can create a file .gitignore that tells git to ignore certain files.  That&#39;s GITIGNORE, but in all lowercase, with a PERIOD in front of it: .gitignore. Remember that in Linux files that have a period in front of them are hidden. At the command prompt, you can view them by typing <strong>ls -la</strong>.</p>
<p>You might create a file called <strong>.gitignore</strong> with this content:</p>
<pre><code>Thumbs.db
</code></pre><p>This tells Git to ignore all the files in your repository that are called <strong>Thumbs.db</strong>.</p>
<p>You could then tell it to ignore the contents of the <strong>temp</strong> directory, the <strong>.metadata</strong> directory and the <strong>node_modules</strong> directory:</p>
<pre><code>Thumbs.db
temp/*
.metadata
node_modules
</code></pre><p>Here is how to ignore everything but the source directory:</p>
<pre><code>*
!Source/
</code></pre><p>And here is a complex example that includes a comment:    </p>
<pre><code># Ignore everything in the &quot;charlie&quot; directory, except certain directories

charlie/*
charlie/development/*
charlie/development/web/*
charlie/development/web/JavaScript/images/
charlie/development/web/HtmlGuide/images/
charlie/development/web/CssGuide/images/
!charlie/development/
!charlie/development/web/
!charlie/development/web/CssGuide/
!charlie/development/web/JavaScript/
!charlie/development/web/HtmlGuide/
</code></pre><p>Add and check in your .gitignore file:</p>
<pre><code>add .gitignore
commit -m &quot;Adding GitIgnore File&quot;
git push
</code></pre><h2 id="create-a-new-repository">Create a New Repository</h2>
<p>Suppose you want to create a new repository. Typically you would start by creating the repository on a remote service such a BitBucket or Github.  After signing into your BitBucket or GitHub account, you will see a button for creating the repository. Push the button and create an empty repository. Don&#39;t put anything in the repository, not even a README.md file. Just leave it empty.</p>
<p>Next, make sure <a href="http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/development/cloud/SshFtpsPutty.html#sshKeys">you have an SSH private key and public key pair</a> on your client machine, and store the public key portion in BitBucket or GitHub, depending on the service you are using. To do this, first open the public key (id_rsa.pub) in an editor such as <strong>geany</strong>, <strong>nano</strong> or <strong>notepad++</strong>. Block copy it, then paste it into the appropriate field on the GitHub or BitBucket web site. In particular, on BitBucket, choose <strong>manage account</strong> from the icon in the upper right portion of the BitBucket site, and then select <strong>ssh keys</strong> from the menu on the left. On GitHub, choose the <strong>gear</strong> icon at the top right of the site, and then select <strong>SSH keys</strong> from the menu on the left. Don&#39;t forget to call ssh-add on your private (id_rsa) key, as described at the link shown above.</p>
<p>Now that you have SSH set up, go to the directory you want to use as the basis for your repository. If you don&#39;t have such a repository, then start from scratch:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir MyRepo
cd MyRepo
</code></pre><p>No initialize git by typing typing <strong>git init</strong>.  This converts an ordinary directory into a Git repository. In particular, it creates a hidden directory called <strong>.git</strong>. In that directory, it stores all the files necessary to configure and maintain your repository.</p>
<p>Then get the command from bitbucket or github that is used to designate where your remote repository resides. The command might look like this, though the exact url at the end will likely differ in your case:</p>
<pre><code>git remote add origin ssh://git@bitbucket.org/lucia/myrepo.git
</code></pre><p>Then add some content to your repository and add and commit your content:</p>
<pre><code>echo MyReadMe &gt; README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m &quot;Adding a readme to my new repo&quot;
</code></pre><p>If you have multiple changes that you want to add and commit at one time, then use a period in your call to <strong>git add</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>git add .
git commit -m &quot;Initial commit&quot;    
</code></pre><p>In the first example, we added just a README.md file to the repository. In the second example, we added any new or updated files to your repository.</p>
<p>Finally, add the following command to push your repo to BitBucket:</p>
<pre><code>git push -u origin --all
</code></pre><p>After this first time, you will be able to push like this:</p>
<pre><code>git push
</code></pre><p>It&#39;s only the first time you need to add <strong>-u origin --all</strong>.</p>
<p>To sum up, if you have an existing repository, and you want to push it from the shell do something like this, where the exact URL for your repository will of course be different from the one shown here:</p>
<pre><code>git remote add origin git@github.com:charliecalvert/DeleteMeNow.git
// Add some content
git push -u origin master
</code></pre><p>Sometimes you will have a session that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>G:\Src\Git\foo&gt;git push -u origin --all
No refs in common and none specified; doing nothing.
Perhaps you should specify a branch such as &#39;master&#39;.
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
Everything up-to-date
</code></pre><p>If you get an error like that, it means you forgot to run git add and git 
commit.</p>
<p>Here is a summary of the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Load your SSH private key in pageant and ensure your public key is stored on
BitBucket.</li>
<li>Go to the directory you want to export and typing: git init</li>
<li>Use the <strong>git add</strong> and <strong>git commit</strong> commands to commit your files into your new repository.</li>
<li>Then type: git remote add origin ssh://git@bitbucket.org/lucia/myrepo.git</li>
<li>Then type: git push -u origin --all</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the instructions from GitHub, which are just a variation on what I write above:</p>
<pre><code>echo &quot;Some Text&quot; &gt;&gt; README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m &quot;first commit&quot;
git remote add origin git@github.com:charliecalvert/DeleteMeNow.git
git push -u origin master
</code></pre><p>Here are the instructions from BitBucket, which are just just a variation on what I say above:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir /path/to/your/project
cd /path/to/your/project
git init
git remote add origin git@bitbucket.org:ccalvert/deletemenow3.git

echo &quot;Charlie Calvert&quot; &gt;&gt; contributors.txt
git add contributors.txt
git commit -m &#39;Initial commit with contributors&#39;
git push -u origin master
</code></pre><h2 id="add-origin">More on git remote add origin</h2>
<p>Sometimes the issue can also be that you need to set to the URL with command like this:</p>
<pre><code>git remote add origin ssh://git@bitbucket.org/lucia/myrepo.git
</code></pre><p>Suppose you create a new repository:</p>
<pre>mkdir foo
$ cd foo
$ git init
</pre>

<p>Now you have a new repository. Your <strong>.git/config</strong> file looks like this:</p>
<pre>
$ cat .git/config 
[core]
    repositoryformatversion = 0
    filemode = true
    bare = false
    logallrefupdates = true
charlie@MountainStreamsLinux
</pre>

<p>Now run our command and then look at <strong>.git/config</strong></p>
<pre>$ git remote add origin ssh://git@bitbucket.org/lucia/myrepo.git
~/temp/foo
$ cat .git/config 
[core]
    repositoryformatversion = 0
    filemode = true
    bare = false
    logallrefupdates = true
[remote "origin"]
    url = ssh://git@bitbucket.org/lucia/myrepo.git
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
~/temp/foo
</pre>


<h2 id="git-config-file">Git CONFIG File</h2>
<p>The git config file holds several important facts. One of the most important
is the URL used to access to your git repository. </p>
<p>The config file is called <strong>config</strong> and it is stored in a hidden directory 
at the root of your repository called .git. Here is the line in the config
file that specify&#39;s your URL:</p>
<pre><code>[remote &quot;origin&quot;]
    url = git@github.com:charliecalvert/JsObjects.git
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
</code></pre><p>If you they ask you to set your global user.email, you can write something like
this:</p>
<pre><code>git config --global user.email &quot;me@somewhere.com&quot;
</code></pre><p>This information is usually writting to $HOME/.gitconfig. For instance:</p>
<pre><code>c:\users\username\.gitconfig
</code></pre><p>Or on Linux:</p>
<pre><code>\home\username\.gitconfig
</code></pre><p>Or on the Mac:</p>
<pre><code>\users\username\.gitconfig
</code></pre><p>If you are guru, and this gets really mixed up, try looking in:</p>
<pre><code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\etc\profile    
</code></pre><p>In particular, one time I found my environment had a variable in it called
HOME that was pointing to some nonsense value like /home/ubuntu, even though
I was on a Windows machine.    </p>
<p>In the .get directory you will find your config file. You can just edit that
file with a text editor. On the other hand, you can use the following to set
values in the global config file found in the main .git directory. The main
.git directory for a user is usually found in your home directory on both
Windows in Linux.</p>
<pre><code>C:\\Users\\Charlie\&gt;git config --global user.name &quot;charliecalvert&quot;
C:\\Users\\Charlie\&gt;git config --global user.email &quot;noone@nowhere.net&quot;
</code></pre><p>You can pass in a length of time you want git to cache your password:</p>
<pre><code>git config --global credential.helper cache --timeout=900
</code></pre><h2 id="git-overwrite-local-changes">Git Overwrite Local Changes</h2>
<p>If you want to refresh the entire local repository, overwriting your
changes, do this:</p>
<pre><code>git fetch
git reset --hard
</code></pre><p>Or, you can specify the repository you want to reset from:</p>
<pre><code>git fetch
git reset --hard origin/master
</code></pre><p>If you have a single file in the local repository that you have edited, 
and you want to throw away those changes, but keep your other changes,
then do this:</p>
<pre><code>git fetch
git checkout origin/master &lt;MyFile&gt;    
</code></pre><h2 id="git-urls-and-ssh">Git URLs and SSH</h2>
<p>There are three ways to interact with a GIT repository on a site like GitHub
or BitBucket:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can have read only access to the repository. This will let you check 
files out, but you cannot make changes and check them back in. This is what 
you want if you are using some third party library. </li>
<li>You can have HTTPs access to the library, which will enable you to check 
in and check out. Access to the library is then usually controlled with a 
user name and password. If you are uncomfortable with SSH, this will 
probably be the simplest option for you.</li>
<li>You can have SSH access to the repository. If you are at all familiar with 
SSH, you will probably find this option easiest when working with Git. If 
you have a key loaded with a tool lie <em>Pageant</em> or <em>ssh-add</em>, then you can 
check in and check out without having to worry about typing in your user 
name and password. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>NOTE</em>: Many tools, such as GitHub for Windows, can handle your password for 
you automatically. That means they work well with HTTPs connections. To get 
that benefit, you need to be in the GitHub GUI, or in the shells 
associated with those GUI&#39;s. These tools work well, and I encourage you to 
use them. However, there are times when it is nice to be able to check in 
and out of Git without having to use a specific tool. In those cases, many 
people will find it easiest to use SSH.</p>
<p>To connect to a site using SSH, you need to do two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Load or reference the private portion of your SSH key on your local machine.     </li>
<li>Cache your SSH key on the remote machine. Both BitBucket and GitHub have 
locations on their web site where you can cache your public keys. On 
BitBucket, choose <em>Manage Account - SSH keys</em>. On GitHub, choose <em>Edit your 
profile - SSH Keys</em>. </li>
</ul>
<p>There are several types of URLs you can use with Git. Only one of them sets up
your repository to use SSH. Here is the type of URL you would use when checking 
out a read only copy of a repository:</p>
<pre><code>git://github.com/someone/JsObjects.git
</code></pre><p>The above URL does not depend on SSH. When you use a URL that looks like the
one shown below, then you are saying you want to work with a read/write copy of 
the repository in SSH mode:</p>
<pre><code>git@github.com:someone/JsObjects.git
</code></pre><p>Let&#39;s put them right next to each other so you can compare:</p>
<pre><code>git://github.com/someone/JsObjects.git 
git@github.com:someone/JsObjects.git
</code></pre><p>Notice the readonly version (the first one) has slashes where the readwrite 
version has at (@) symbols or colons.</p>
<p>None of this is specific to GitHub. The same syntax applies when working 
with files stored in any remote repository. Here, for instance, is an SSH 
URL for bitbucket:</p>
<pre><code>git@bitbucket.org:someone/deleteme.git
</code></pre><p>Here is a URL for an HTTPS readwrite connection to a repository:</p>
<pre><code>https://github.com/charliecalvert/bc-basic.git
</code></pre><p>There URLs are easy to identify since they begin with the letters https. </p>
<p><em>NOTE: Further down in this document you will learn about creating URLs for local 
repositories.</em></p>
<h2 id="what-url-is-my-connection-using-">What URL is My Connection Using?</h2>
<p>The URL for your repository is usually kept in the .git directory at the 
root of your repository. (Sometimes this folder is hidden, even on Windows. 
You can look for hidden files or folders, or just go ahead and type <em>cd .git</em>, 
and assume it will work if you are in the root of your repository.) If you 
want to change the URL your repository uses by default, you can open the 
<em>config</em> file in your .git directory and edit this line:</p>
<pre><code>[remote &quot;origin&quot;]
url = git@github.com:charliecalvert/JsObjects.git
