        You can run the PING command to find out if you are connected to the Internet. Also, run&nbsp;<strong>ifconfig</strong>&nbsp;on Linux, and&nbsp;<strong>ipconfig /all</strong>&nbsp;on Windows.</p>

    <p>Figure 03: There are two active network adapters on my system. One is for my ethernet cable, the other for wifi. If I connect to a VM, and choose Realtek Family Controler, but there is no Ethernet cable plugged in to my laptop, then I am going to have a trouble. As a result, I usually use WiFiLink because it works even if the cable is not plugged in. However, on my machine, it often seems like it is either/or, not both. In other words, when I plug in my ethernet cable, I loose my WiFi. Therefore, I need to be sure I am choosing the right option. Fortunately, VirtualBox lets you switch adapters while a VM is loaded. Notice in this screen show that some options are grayed out. That is because the VM called Ubuntu 32 Minimal is currently running. But even though some options are grayed out, the option to choose a new adapter is still available, and I can switch back and forth at run time. However, it often takes about 15 to 30 seconds before the change registers with the VM. So you need patience.</p>

<h2>Notes on Virtualization Networking Deep Dive</h2>

<p>Layer-3 networking, HSRP (Hot Swap Routing Protocol) or<br>VRRP (Virtual 
Routing Redundancy Protocol), link aggregation,<br>VLANs and VLAN</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>a<br>pile of gigabit copper ports or a smaller number of 10G<br>copper or 
fiber Ethernet ports.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you have the<br>budget to deliver multiple 10G links to each 
virtualization<br>host, then by all means, go that route</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The use of VLANs in a virtualized infrastructure is a must.You can also use 
the enhanced control afforded by VLANs<br>to constrain certain VMs to their own 
specific network, and<br>in some cases, create airlocked VLANs that can be used 
in<br>development environments. There’s</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are three main methods<br>of delivering shared storage to a 
virtualization host: iSCSI,<br>NFS, or Fibre Channel.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If NFS is the choice, then there isn’t much to do on the<br>host side, as the 
storage array will be busy handling the<br>NFS serving, with the virtualization 
host acting as the client.<br>There are definitely benefits to using NFS as a VM 
store,<br>such as ease of backup and restore. But there are detriments<br>as 
well -- notably, the inability for some virtualization solutions<br>to create 
raw disk mappings on NFS-based storage.</p>

<p>If it’s 10G, then in most cases it’s as simple<br>as connecting two 10G links 
to the core switches with<br>VLAN trunking and link aggregation.</p>

<p>To sum up the basic host configuration: six 1G interfaces<br>in bonded pairs 
for front-end, back-end, and storage<br>links. For a 10G-equipped host, we’ll 
have just the<br>pair of 10G links configured in a failover or bonded pair.</p>
