<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Git is a free, open source version control system. It allows you to track the different versions of code that you produce. With Git, you can run the clock backwards, finding old versions of your code, and you can compare one version with another version.</p>
<p>Version control has been around a long time. What makes Git different is the way it handles repositories. Git has a distributed model that allows you to clone repositories onto your local machine. In the past, there was only version of the repository, typically somewhere on your local internet. Git is quite different, in that you can have multiple versions of your repository. This means  you can have a local version of the repository and check in and check out from there before deciding that you want to push to the main repository.</p>
<p>Git is a sophisticated tool, and it is not easy to learn. It is however, the dominant
tool of its kind, and with good reason. It is powerful, flexible, and robust. Ultimately,
Git is worth mastering. In fact, much of the basic functionality of Git is relatively
easy to master once you understand how it works.</p>

<h2>Centers of Activity</h2>
<p>Below you find links to the main site for Git. You will also find their
download page and related links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://git-scm.com/">http://git-scm.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">http://git-scm.com/downloads</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are many Git servers in the cloud. Here are two that everyone should know
about:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com</a></li>
<li>Bitbucket: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">https://bitbucket.org/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You probably want to have accounts on both GitHub and Bitbucket. Everyone uses
GitHub, and bitbucket competes by allowing you to have free private accounts.</p>

<h2>GIT Guides found on the Web</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve put together various resources include a <a href="http://youtu.be/p1obmWF6Nks">video</a>. I&#39;ve also put together <a href="http://www.ccalvert.net/books/CloudNotes/Assignments/GitNewRepo.html">a walk through/assignment</a> that can help you get started with Git on Linux. Also, I have a <a href="http://bit.ly/git-basics">slide deck on git</a>.</p>

<h2>Is Git Reliable?</h2>
<p>Topics like &quot;is git reliable?&quot;, &quot;is it me, or is it git?&quot; come up from time to time. My concern is that students will spin their wheels, focusing on imaginary problems with git, rather than trying to problem solve.</p>
<p>The following stats were assembled in Feb, 2016:</p>
<ul>
<li>Git is used by 42.9 percent of all software developers</li>
<li>In the UK, nearly one quarter (23.5) of developer job postings cite git. The details:<ul>
<li>23.5% Git</li>
<li>16.3% Subversion</li>
<li>11.58% Microsoft Team Software Foundation</li>
<li>1.62% Mercurial (like Git, but easier to use)</li>
<li>1.13% Visual Source Safe</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Git hub has about 12 million users and 31 million repositories. Tha&#39;s just github, not total git users. You can use git and not use any cloud repository, or use git and use a different cloud repository such as Bitbucket.</li>
</ul>
<p>Related links which probably contain updates to total github users:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/about">https://github.com/about</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/explore">https://github.com/explore</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, it is always possible that one of us will hit a bug in git. All I can say is that the odds we hit a git bug when performing basic operations with git is very, very low.</p>
<p>Git is not perfect. No piece of software is perfect. But git is, in my opinion, one of the most reliable, tested, and proven software programs in the world.</p>
<a class="anchor" id="git-versus"></a>
<h2>Git vs DropBox</h2>
<p>There are some tools such as DropBox, GoogleDrive and OneDrive that will automatically propagate changes to any machine that subscribes to updates. Git, on the other hand, is designed to let developers, or authors, work on a set of documents and then share them when and as needed. The advantages to the second scenario (git), for a certain type of activity, are two fold:</p>
<ul>
<li>No changes are seen until the author is ready to share them. We can work on a rough draft, or on an algorithm, until it is polished, and then share it. If code were propagated automatically as we made changes, we would likely &quot;break the build&quot; for other developers. Our half finished code would appear on others machines as we worked on it. Results of sharing half finished code could be errors in the compilation process (npm start fails to work), or unexpected bugs in working code. A related scenario, perhaps a bit closer to home, would be a student who does not want to share their work with their teacher until it is complete. Or conversely, wants to share it before it is complete in order to ask a question, but does not want to share just any version, but rather a particular version. If changes were propagated automatically, the student could not work on their code until the teacher had reviewed it.</li>
<li>From the other side, a developer might not want to see another person&#39;s changes until they are ready for them. Even if the code that was automatically propagated to their machine did work correctly, it can be disconcerting to have to program against services, objects and APIs that change without warning.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think all that goes at least some of the way to explaining why Git works the way it does.</p>
<p>Sharing documents is a good and common use of a tool like Git. When working with documents rather than code, the consequences of automatically pushing updates is less severe, but still real. Suppose I&#39;m putting together a list of steps that must be followed. If I accidentally leave out a few steps in my first draft, then people who are following my changes live are likely to be miffed that my guide does not work. Or perhaps we begin working on a description of a seven step process. We get to step 5, then get called to dinner, or head off to bed. People reading the document would then begin following my steps, only to find that the description is incomplete.</p>
<p>There are, of course, strong arguments for exactly the opposite kind of functionality. If I&#39;m taking notes on a lecture in Evernote, at the end of class I want them to be propagated automatically and immediately so I can access them as needed from home. There is no advantage in that scenario to any other system. Leaving a copy of my notes at school without being able to access them from home would have no advantages. I want to see all changes immediately on all machines where I log into Evernote.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that there are many different ways to share information in the cloud. The only way to learn which one is best for which task is to learn the tools, and begin experimenting with them. Everyone is working these things out for themselves just now. Unfortunately, students in the future will probably be told to use tool X for purpose Y, and tool W for Z. Neat and clean, but not nearly as fun as exploring this world on your own. We live in interesting times.</p>
