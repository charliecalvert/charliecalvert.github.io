<p>Here we cover basics facts about strategy, tools and theory. You learn
enough to get started. After reading this page, you can move on to
the page on <a href="JavaScriptsBasics.html">JavaScript Basics</a>.</p>
<h2 id="general-considerations">General Considerations</h2>
<p>The best programmers take pride in their code. The first step on the road to
creating good code is to make it readable. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Carefully choose names for your identifiers</li>
<li>Format your code in accordance with popular conventions</li>
<li>Architect your code properly so it is easy to understand. (Use the right
algorithms and patterns, and create the right objects and modules.)</li>
</ul>
<p>After taking the above steps, check to see if you have a performance
problem. If so, use a profiler to measure performance and find the slow
spots. Then review your architecture and see if there are ways to speed
things up.</p>
<h2 id="introductionToJavaScript">Introduction to JavaScript</h2>
<p>Large parts of the web are driven by three related technologies: HTML, CSS
and JavaScript. Though the differences between the roles played by these
technologies can blur at times, the following assertions will help you
understand the primary purpose of each component:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML files contain content such as text, bitmaps or videos</li>
<li>CSS let&#39;s you define how the content should appear</li>
<li>JavaScript allows you to perform actions that animate that content</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible to completely scramble these rolls. For instance, you can put
content in JavaScript files and use HTML to define the appearance of your
content. It is not, however, always considered good practice to do any of
these things. Some good developers follow the guidelines for apportioning roles in most, but
not all cases. I prefer, however, to take a hard line, and to insist that content,
and content alone be placed in HTML files, that appearance be specified only in
CSS files, and that JavaScript be used only to perform actions.</p>
<p>At this stage, I am keeping the terms I&#39;m using deliberately vague. I have
not rigorously defined what I mean by the &quot;appearance&quot; of a page, or what it
means to performs an action with a JavaScript file. I believe, however, that
I will succeed in making making these concepts clear over time. The reader
simply has to have patience, and over time you should develop a clear and
well defined understanding of the roles played by each of the three
components of a web page.</p>
<h2 id="style-guide">Style Guide</h2>
<p>My goal is to teach people with average abilities to write code. I picture the
average reader of this material as being someone most people would label as
&quot;smart&quot; or &quot;intelligent.&quot; What does that mean? One could find define various
metrics, most of which would be useless. Perhaps it would be helpful to talk
about people who tested in the top third of their classes at school, minus the
very top one or two percent. In some cases, people who tested well below that
level could still learn from my text, but it will probably be the exception
rather than the rule.</p>
<p>So why do I use the word average, if I mean someone in the top third of
their class? Most people who become interested in programming are fairly
intelligent. People who don&#39;t have good logical skills simply never get far
enough in their computer studies to ever write a line of code. Or if they do
get that far, they get discouraged very quickly.</p>
<p>There are, however, a lot of programmers who exhibit reasonable skill as
programmers, but who struggle with the most advanced concepts. It is this
group of people who I try to target what I write.</p>
<p>Programming is a profession that attacts some of the smartest people in the
world. For good reason, the future of programming is often defined by people
with extraordinary skills. I&#39;ve been fortunate enough to meet a number of
people with that kind of intelligence, and throughout this text I will
frequently refer people to their web pages or pass on advice spoken or
written by these elite programmers. These super smart people are not,
however, the target audience for whom I write.</p>
<h2 id="performance-vs-maintainability">Performance vs Maintainability</h2>
<p>There are several metrics that can be used to define great code. Our primary
goal is to write a program that people want to use. That means it needs to
be useful, fun, or appealing in some other sense. It must also be easy
enough to use that people are willing to take the time to master it. Making
our code useful and easy to use is a necessity, but those are really design
issues, and not fodder for a purely technical work such as the one I&#39;m
writing here. This text assumes that you have a good idea, and a plan for its
design. My goal is to help you realize those goals by helping your write
good code.</p>
<p>There are three virtues shared by all good code: it is robust, fast, and
maintainability. I rank these three virtues as follows. The best code is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Maintainable</li>
<li>Robust</li>
<li>Fast</li>
</ol>
<p>This may seem like an obvious hierarchy, but it is my experience that many
developers actually rank these three virtues as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Speed</li>
<li>Robustness</li>
<li>Maintainability</li>
</ol>
<p>If confronted, many developers would agree that it is more important for code
to be robust than it is for it to be fast. Nevertheless, when they actually sit
down to write code, they end up prioritizing speed over everything else. They
may not even be aware that they are doing it, but they are.</p>
<p>If your program crashes frequently, then it is unlikely that anyone will want
to use it. So that is our first priority. The problem is that some people are
so determined to make their code fast, that they end up sacrificing reliability
on the alter of speed. This is not a good outcome. Your code must be robust
or few will want to use it.</p>
<p>It happens that code that is not easy to maintain is rarely robust. A developer
who seeks to fix a bug must understand not only how to fix the bug, but what
impact that fix will have on the rest of the program. In other words, your code
must be maintainable if it is going to be robust. Seen from this perspective,
our ranking needs to be as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Maintainablity</li>
<li>Robustness</li>
<li>Speed</li>
</ol>
<p>Our primary goal is to make our code robust, but we can&#39;t achieve that end
if we don&#39;t first make our code maintainable. In many ways, the art of
writing robust code is the art of learning how to write code that is
maintainable, that is easy to understand. If you can create code that is
both maintainable and robust, then you will be able to refactor it in ways
that also make it fast.</p>
<p>So far, we have advanced through to layers:</p>
<ol>
<li>The top layer is about design and usability</li>
<li>The next layer is about performance, robustness, and maintainability</li>
</ol>
<p>It is turns out, however, that there is a third factor that needs to be kept
in mind when you are learning how to write code. Ultimately, your ability to
write good code depends upon your understanding of two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Good programming principles</li>
<li>A deep understanding of your tools and language.</li>
</ol>
<p>By programming principles I&#39;m talking about things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agile Design</li>
<li>Program Architecture</li>
<li>Team dynamics</li>
<li>Testing</li>
<li>Communication</li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, those subjects, though very important, are a bit outside the scope
of this work. I will try to always encourage the use of good programming
principles, but I will not always take the time to define them. I will however,
work hard to make it easy for you to understand how the tools and language
that you are going to use work. In particular, in these pages, I will try
to give good, deep explanations of how JavaScript works.</p>
<p>Having a deep, intuitive, understanding of JavaScript is crucial if you want to
write good code. You will constantly be forced to make implementation decisions
when you write code. You will not be able to make any of those decisions unless
you first have an understanding of features are available in the language, and
when and how to use them.</p>
<h2 id="some-caveats">Some Caveats</h2>
<p>Having laid out the goals and principles on which we shall be working, I think
it is important to make some additional points.</p>
<p>Some advanced students will find points in my text where they might think:
&quot;Hey, I know a better way to do that! My way uses less code, or my way saves
10 clock cycles.&quot; All that is good and well, but is the code that you
propose also both maintainable and easy to understand? Are you sacrificing
maintainability on the alter of speed? In some cases, I may in fact know
about that &quot;better way,&quot; but I have chosen to stick to a simple, easier to
understand syntax in order to teach people how to write robust, easy to
maintain code.</p>
<p>In saying this, I&#39;m not trying to create an impenetrable boundary behind
which I can hide. Of course, there will be cases where there really will be
a simpler and easier way to do something than the one I show. If you think
you have found a better way to do something, then please write me and let me
know. Before you write, however, consider whether your code is not only
small and fast, but also easy to read, and easy to maintain. For me, these
virtues are more important than brevity or performance. This does not mean
that I don&#39;t take brevity and performance into account, but only that they
are not my first priority.</p>
<p>I believe many of these developers are quite capable of creating good
programs that would meet their own needs and the needs of most users.
However, they never achieve their goals because they are too focused on
performance. In short, they are aiming to high. They want to make their code
impossibly fast, and end up creating programs that no one, not even
themselves can maintain. As a result, they fail. My goal is to define a
style of programming that can help these developers achieve their goals.</p>
<h2 id="creativity">Creativity</h2>
<p>There are various metrics by which we can define someone&#39;s talents. For
instance, some people who have enormous analytic abilities and poor creative
talents. Other people are very creative, but lack analytic ability.</p>
<p>Anyone with great analytic and logical ability is likely to succeed in the
programming profession. But people with a strong creative bent often lack
the analytic skills necessary to help them write good code and bring their
ideas to fruition. One of my goals is to help people like this succeed.</p>
<p>Here is a story that might help to make this point clear. I like jazz, and I&#39;ve
spent a good deal of time reading interviews with Jazz musicians. One of the
musicians at the top of the jazz field is Pat Metheny. To me, he is someone
who seems to have it all: he is very creative and technically superb. Or at least
that is how I perceive him. However, I was surprised one day when I read an
interview with him in which said that he frequently encountered musicians with
technical chops that far exceeded his own. If I understood him correctly, he
was saying that it was his intense work ethic combined with strong creative
skills that made him successful.</p>
<p>Pat Metheny does in fact have very strong technical chops, more than he was
willing to own up to in that particular interview. Nevertheless, I think the
story has a lesson that is worth remembering: it is not always purely
technical skill alone that counts. Your discipline, creativity, business smarts,
or good idea will never be worth anything if you can&#39;t bring your idea to
fruition. My goal is to teach a manner of programming that people of &quot;average&quot;
talent can use to help them acomplish their goals.</p>
<h2 id="be-practical">Be Practical</h2>
<p>Let me try one final approach to this subject before moving on. The
techniques that outline in my text are one&#39;s that I have learned from
personal experience. Many times I have started writing a program, only to
find myself bogged down in details that threatened to overwhelm me. Over
time I began to sense that I was trying to emulate code that was brilliant,
but that contained featuires not really needed in my particular case. I
could achieve my goals by stripping away layers of complexity. At times that
meant I had to limit the features in my program, but frequently these
features were not nearly as important as they were costly. In the end, I
ended up with a shorter, simpler program than the one I initially meant to
write. But my program worked and my users liked it. Oddly enough, on the few
occasions when I had to the chance to show my work to one of the super smart
programmers discussed above, they too liked what I had done. Yes, they
probably could have written a fancier program, but they were practical
people. They saw that my code worked, and that I had found a way to bring a
unique idea to fruition. In short, I was much better off with a robust
program that worked, than with a flakey program that was cool but not
reliable. And when they looked at my code, they rarely complained. It was
simple but robust. It is hard to criticize code that works! Often simple
code that works is better even than fancy code that works, but which is
entirely unmaintainable due to its complexity. But now I am getting ahead of
my subject.</p>
<p>To sum up the topic covered in this part of the text, I would say the
following: A lot of good developers have missed their chance to create a
useful or important program because they have focused too much on writing
&quot;clever&quot; code that is fast and small, but which is also hard to debug,
maintain and understand. Instead of focusing on speed and size, focus on the
following concepts, and others that will be developed throughout this text.
Write code that:</p>
<ul>
<li>is easy to read</li>
<li>is easy to maintain</li>
<li>Contains only absolutely necessary features</li>
<li>Sacrifices features that will be used by only a small percentage of users</li>
<li>is aligned with best practices, especially those outlined by the Agile school
of development</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="helloWorldAtTheCommandPrompt">Hello World at the Command Prompt</h2>
<p>If you want to learn JavaScript, it can be helpful to start with a
command line utility. One possible course of action is to install node,
and run scripts from the command prompt:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/charlie/development/web/JavaScript/NodeJs.html">Node on Elvenware</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Another solution is to install Rhino:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-<span class="hljs-keyword">get</span> install rhino
rhino-jsc
</code></pre><p>Built into Windows is a tool called cscript.exe. It is nice, but don&#39;t not
always do what you want. For instance, console.log does not appear to be
defined. Instead you need to use something like <strong>WScript.Print &quot;Foo&quot;</strong>.</p>
<p>For Mac types, see:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.phpied.com/javascript-shell-scripting/">http://www.phpied.com/javascript-shell-scripting/</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="helloWorldInTheBrowser">Hello World in the Browser</h2>
<p>JavaScript can be written as a standalone script that runs from the
command prompt like a batch file or shell script. It can also be run as
server side code like Python or PHP via a relatively new technology
called <a href="http://nodejs.org/">nodejs</a>. Most commonly, however, JavaScript
is imbedded in or attached to an HTML file.</p>
<p>In Listing 01, for instance, you can see a very simple &quot;Hello World&quot;
program that uses JavaScript. You can save this file as
<strong>VerySimple.html</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Listing 01: Hello world in JavaScript.</strong></p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">html</span>&gt;</span>

 </span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">script</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">head</span>&gt;</span>

<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">body</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">body</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">html</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p>What are you supposed to do with this file? Well, you can open it in a
web browser, and see the output that it produces. This is usually simply
a matter of using the Windows Explorer or some similar tool to locate
your file. Then you can double click on it, or right click and choose
&quot;Open with...&quot; Because the file has an HTML extension, it should open
automatically in a web browser or allow you to choose the browser in
which you want to run it. Most browsers will also let you choose <strong>File
| Open</strong> from the menu and browse for the file you want to open. If you
are using Chrome, press Ctrl + O to open a file.</p>
<p><img src="images/VerySimpleJavaScript.png" alt="Very Simple JavaScript file"></p>
<p><strong>Figure 01: The VerySimple02.html file running in Chrome.</strong></p>
<p>You can see the path to the file in the address bar. This is a normal
Windows path with slashes rather than back-slashes. Notice also that it
is prefaced with the code <strong>file:///.</strong>. Later you can learn how to set
up a web server to publish your code, but for now, it is fine to just
browse for the file on your hard drive.</p>
<p>In the above example, the JavaScript is embedded in the head element.
Alternatively, you can place your JavaScript smack dab in the middle of
your HTML:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-%7B.code%7D"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">html</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">head</span>&gt;</span>
 <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">meta</span> <span class="hljs-attr">content</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"text/html; charset=utf-8"</span> <span class="hljs-attr">http-equiv</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"Content-Type"</span>&gt;</span>
 <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">title</span>&gt;</span>Very Simple<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">title</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">head</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">body</span>&gt;</span>
        <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">script</span> <span class="hljs-attr">type</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"text/javascript"</span>&gt;</span><span class="javascript">
               <span class="hljs-built_in">document</span>.writeln(<span class="hljs-string">"&lt;p&gt;A very simple JavaScript Hello-World program.&lt;/p&gt;"</span>);
        </span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">script</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">body</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">html</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>I prefer, however, not to put HTML and JavaScript in the same file.
Instead, I create two or more files: one for my html; one or more for my
JavaScript. I then provide a link from the \<head\> element in the HTML
to my JavaScript file or files:</p>
<p><strong>Listing 03: The HTML File</strong></p>
<pre><code class="lang-%7B.code%7D"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">html</span>&gt;</span>

<p><strong>Listing 04: The JavaScript file: VerySimple.js.</strong></p>

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note: You can download this sample from
<a href="http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/downloads/VerySimple.zip">here</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: When running the code in Listings 03 and 04, you should be
sure to put both files in the same directory. For instance, you may have
a folder called <strong>C:\Src</strong> where you store your source files. Put both
files in that directory:</p>
<pre><code>C:<span class="hljs-tag">\<span class="hljs-name">Src</span></span><span class="hljs-tag">\<span class="hljs-name">VerySimple</span></span>.html
C:<span class="hljs-tag">\<span class="hljs-name">Src</span></span><span class="hljs-tag">\<span class="hljs-name">VerySimple</span></span>.js
</code></pre><p>I believe it is nearly always best not to put your JavaScript code in
the same file as your HTML. I believe this, despite the fact that there
is nothing inherently wrong with putting JavaScript and HTML in the same
file. Certainly your code will work if you follow that pattern. However,
I consider it a good practice to always separate your HTML code into
three files:</p>
<ul>
<li>Put your content in HTML files with an HTML extension: MyFile.html</li>
<li>Put your presentation code in CSS files with a CSS extension:
MyFile.css</li>
<li>Put your JavaScript in JavaScript files with JS extension:
MyFile.js</li>
</ul>
<p>If you need to use the same CSS or JavaScript in multiple HTML files,
then it is obvious that it is best to put that CSS or JavaScript in a
separate file. Otherwise, you would be forced to endlessly repeat the
same code in multiple HTML files. Then, if you wanted to fix a bug in
your JavaScript or CSS, you would need to fix it in each HTML file that
included the code. In a large web site, that might mean you would need
to edit thousands of HTML files just to make one simple fix.</p>
<p>But suppose you CSS or JavaScript that you only wanted to use in one
file? Why should you split them up into three files? Wouldn&#39;t it mean
that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your code ran faster because there would be one download instead of
3?</li>
<li>It would be easier to make sure that code that belonged together
never got separated?</li>
</ul>
<p>The answer to both these questions is yes. And still, despite these
arguments, I think you should always separate your code out into three
files. I believe this for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It promotes good habits</li>
<li>More often than you think, there will come a time when you will want
to use the CSS or JavaScript in a second HTML file. If it is not
already split out into multiple files, then you will get lazy and
copy it from one file to another, ending up with duplicate code.</li>
<li>Ultimately, it is easier to write good clean, easy to read, and easy
to maintain code if you don&#39;t mix different types of source in a
single file</li>
<li>And finally, there are tools that can be run over HTML files before
you release them that will automatically consolidate them into a
single file.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>NOTE: This last point is not really as good an argument as it sounds.
Ultimately, I believe you are better off with a maintainable code base
that runs a bit slow, than you are with a fast code base that is
impossible to understand, maintain or improve. Furthermore, most
developers who try to optimize their code end up spending hours, days,
or even months fussing with code in order to save milliseconds that the
user never notices. The rule you want to follow is simple: unless you
can see obvious, and certain, proof that you have a performance problem,
you should not waste time trying to optimize your code. Instead, focus
on writing clean code that is easy to maintain. One thing we know for
certain: users always prefer code that works and has the right features
to code that does not work and lacks key features. If you write messy,
hard to maintain code, you will nearly always find it harder to add
features to that code base than it is to add features to well written
programs.</em></p>
<h2 id="theCaseOfFileNames">The Case of File Names</h2>
<p>I should say a word about the case of the file names I create. There are
six different ways to name files, three of which are wrong, and three of
which are right:</p>
<ol>
<li>file01.html</li>
<li>vrysmpl.html</li>
<li>verysimple.html</li>
<li>very_simple.html</li>
<li>very-simple.html</li>
<li>VerySimple.html</li>
</ol>
<p>The first example is wrong because the name has no meaning: it tells you
nothing about the contents of the file. The second name is wrong because
it contains abbreviations. Twenty years ago developers used
abbreviations to save space on machines where memory or hard drive space
was scarce, or where operating systems did not support names with more
than 8 characters. This is no longer necessary for a variety of reasons,
and now abbreviations are merely a sign that developers are too lazy to
type out the whole word. (To every rule, there are exceptions, and there
are occasions when the code in very short methods is easier to read when
it makes use of abbreviations. But those are the exceptions to a good
rule, and there is rarely a case where any good is accomplished by
showing newcomers such shortcuts.) The third example is wrong because it
provides no means of helping the reader to separate out the face that
<strong>verysimple</strong> is a name consisting of two words.</p>
<p>The fourth example is correct, but is now considered a bit old
fashioned. Most people prefer using a dash, rather than an underscore,
because they believe it is easier to type. In either case, the basic
strategy is good, because there are no abbreviations, and the words are
cleanly separated. The whole issue of case is moot in this strategy,
since all letters are rendered in lower case. The last example is the
one I prefer, because it is most familiar to me, and I find it easier to
read a long list of names rendered in this format. It uses Pascal
casing, where multiword names are run together into one name, and each
word in the name begins with a capital letter.</p>
<p>NOTE: One good argument from the folks who prefer using dashes to using
Pascal casing runs as follows. Suppose you have a common acronym such as
IBM. Perhaps you have method from IBM that performs fast addition. You
would want to call this method <strong>IBMFastAddition</strong>. This name runs the
words IBM and Fast together into one name and thereby breaks an
important rule about clearly delineating the words in a name. I
therefore would name this method <strong>IbmFastAddition;</strong> now we can clearly
see that Ibm is meant to be treated as a discreet unit. In fact, I
always treat acronyms this way: I capitalize the first letter and put
the other letters in lower case. This system works, but some find it
less than optimal. If you used dashes, you could write something like
this instead: <strong>ibm-fast-addition</strong>. This is arguably easier to read
than the Pascal casing example. But I don&#39;t find so terribly much
difference, and sometimes I think Pascal casing is easier to read. For
instance, I think <strong>SimpleHtmlToElvenwareConverter</strong> is easier to read
than <strong>simple-html-to-elvenware-converter</strong>. But gosh, it is a silly
thing to get upset about. I distrust anyone who gets overly excited
about such issues. I think even great programmers, such as Douglas
Crockford, do little more than display their rare blind spots when they
get overly exercised over issues that so clearly are more matters of
taste than of science. In fact, I have seen people foolishly ignore
Crockford&#39;s many strengths because he is so obviously overly zealous in
this one area. He&#39;s doing more harm to himself than good by being so
narrow minded.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the choice you make between the last three &quot;correct&quot;
examples is a matter of personal taste. There are only two primary
caveats you need to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whatever strategy you pick: stick with it! Once you have decided on
a strategy then you, and everyone who works with you, must stick to
that strategy in all the code you produce.</li>
<li>If you go to work for a shop that has already adopted a strategy,
then you must happily conform with it. A good manager will work with
you, and have patience while you come to see the error of your ways.
Bad managers will simply make your life miserable until you either
come to your senses or move on. In either case, there is no question
that it is irrational and counter productive to create code that
uses a style that does conform to the needs of the others in your
group.</li>
</ul>
<p>The case of a file name is one thing, but the case of formatting code in
a source file is a different matter. Almost all languages have an agreed
upon style of casing, indentation, etc. You should make a real effort to
discover the strategy for the language you are using, and to follow it
as best you can. In this document, I attempt to follow the standards for
formatting JavaScript code. With a few minor exceptions, if you see me
vary from what you consider to be the best strategy for formatting
JavaScript, then please send me email and let me know. My goal is to
conform to the standards set by the JavaScript community. If I want to
assert my individuality, I wrote prose or poetry; when I write code, I
try to conform to standards. The only case for individuality in code is
the case for writing the cleanest, easiest to understand code of any
developer on your team. There is no place for a quirky style of
capitalization or indentation.</p>
<h2 id="aSimpleJavaScriptDevelopmentStrategy">A Simple JavaScript Development Strategy</h2>
<p>JavaScript run in the browser has one set of rules when run in a
browser, and another set when run outside a browser. If you are using
JavaScript primarily to write client side scripts meant to be run in a
browser, then it is best to learn JavaScript, and develop JavaScript,
under that scenario. It is true that there are legitimate and important
ways to run JavaScript from outside the browser. For instance, you can
run JavaScript from the command prompt, or directly from inside some
IDEs. At first, however, such stratagems can lead to much confusion. As
a result, I suggest that you begin by developing JavaScript inside a
browser.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: I should probably qualify what I say above. The basic syntax
of the language does not change when you switch from a browser to some
environment. (The only exception, of course, is when a browser has a
buggy implementation of JavaScript, and that still happens quite
frequently.) But even when everything works correctly, certain key
features of the language, such as the <strong>this</strong> keyword, have a
different significance inside a browser and outside a browser. Also, key
elements of the API, such as the <strong>alert</strong> function, are available in a
browser and not outside a browser. These and other differences become
manageable when you gain proficiency in the language, but at first, it
is best to avoid such subtle pitfalls by running JavaScript in the
environment in which you intend to use it. Of course, if you are
intending to write mostly server side JavaScript with <strong>nodejs</strong>, then
this advice is less convincing. I do not think there are serious
disadvantages to learning JavaScript in a browser even if you want to
use it on the server side, but you will find that there are differences.
In general, I think it is easier to move from the browser to <strong>nodejs</strong>,
than it is to move from <strong>nodejs</strong> to the quirky world of browsers.*</p>
<p>It turns out that the code you saw in the previous section provides a
good framework for beginning and intermediate level JavaScript
programmers who want to learn more about the langauge. Start out by
opening up code similar to what you see in Listing 3 and 4. As a matter
of fact, you can simply reuse VerySimple.html over and over again. As we
explore the JavaScript language, all you need do is change the name of
the JavaScript file that you are linking in. For instance, linking
VerySimple01.js for one program, then VerySimple02.js for the next
program. Better yet, follow best practices and rename each JavaScript
file to reflect its contents. For instance, ExploringLoops.js would be a
good name for a JavaScript file that you created when you wanted to
learn about how loops are written in JavaScript.</p>
<p>Before leaving the subject of how to structure your code, there is one
last subject to cover. A key tool developers use when debugging their
code, and when they are exploring JavaScript, is a call to
<strong>console.log</strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-%7B.code%7D">console.log(<span class="hljs-comment">"This is a a debug message"</span>);
</code></pre>
<h2 id="console.Log">Console.Log</h2>
<p>You can use console.log to log debug information.</p>
<pre><code>console.log(<span class="hljs-symbol">'This</span> line <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> code executed');
</code></pre><p>If you run your JavaScript in a browser, then use the Browser&#39;s debugger to
view the results. For instance, in Chrome, press F12 to bring up the
Developer Tools. Then turn to the <strong>Console</strong> page. If you are using a
command line tool like <strong>node</strong>, then you can see the results at the command
line itself.</p>
<p>Suppose you are a beginning level JavaScript programmer who wants to
learn how to write a function that adds numbers. Now it is a good and
admirable thing to want to design an HTML file that will allow the user
to enter numbers, push a button, and display the result of an operation
on those numbers. However, in this life there is a time for everything,
and lets suppose that right now you don&#39;t want to focus on inputting or
displaying numbers: you just want to write a method called <strong>add</strong>and
see if it works. Here is how you can use console.log to help you
reach your goal.</p>
<p>Begin your the same basic HTML file described above:</p>
<p><strong>Listing 05: The HTML File</strong></p>
<pre><code class="lang-%7B.code%7D"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">html</span>&gt;</span>

<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">head</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">meta</span> <span class="hljs-attr">content</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"text/html; charset=utf-8"</span> <span class="hljs-attr">http-equiv</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"Content-Type"</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">title</span>&gt;</span>Very Simple<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">title</span>&gt;</span>  
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">script</span> <span class="hljs-attr">src</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"calculator.js"</span> <span class="hljs-attr">type</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"text/javascript"</span>&gt;</span><span class="undefined"></span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">script</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">head</span>&gt;</span>

<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">body</span>&gt;</span>    
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">body</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">html</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the code shown in Listing 5 is similar to the code found
in Listing 3. The only difference is that the source file linked in is
called <strong>Calculator.js</strong> rather than <strong>VerySimple.js</strong>. Here is the code
for <strong>Calculator.js</strong>:</p>
<p>Listing 06: Code that uses console.log.</p>
<pre><code>    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">add</span>(<span class="hljs-params">a, b</span>) </span>{
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> a + b;
    }

    <span class="hljs-built_in">window</span>.onload = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{  
      <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> sum = add(<span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>);
      <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(sum);
    };
</code></pre><p>Launch your HTML file in Chrome. Press F12 or Ctrl-Shift+I to open the
Developer Tools and turn to the console page. You should see the output from
any of your console.log statements in the console window. Note also that the
console window allows you to add arbitrary statements that will be run
against the JavaScript on your page.</p>
<p><a href="images/Console01.png"><img src="images/Console01Small.png" alt="Console Window"></a></p>
<p><strong>Figure 0X</strong>: The Chrome JavaScript Console window.</p>
<p>In the screen shot, you can see the output of the call to <strong>console.log</strong>.
I have also used the Chrome console window to explicitly type in some
code:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">add</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-number">6</span>,<span class="hljs-number">12</span>)</span></span>
</code></pre><p>After typing this code, my JavaScript method is called, and the result of the
call to the <strong>add</strong> method is shown. This technique can be used to help you
debug your JavaScript code without having to create an interface for your program.</p>
<p>Note: You can also use
<a href="http://elvenware.com/charlie/development/web/UnitTests/">qUnit</a> to write
unit tests that can help you debug your code. I typically use both
<strong>console.log</strong> and <strong>qUnit</strong>. However, if I were forced to choose between the two
techniques, then I would choose <strong>qUnit</strong> or some other unit test framework. I
am not forced to make that decision, so I use console.log and qUnit. But if
I were forced to choose, I would choose unit testing over logging.
Ultimately, unit testing is a more robust solution. In particular, it is
easy to automate unit tests, while there is no simple way to automate
checking the results of calls to <strong>console.log</strong>. You can visually confirm the
results, but that is not that same as getting an automated error report such
as you get from <strong>qUnit</strong>.</p>

</code></pre><p>This code changes the page you are viewing by inserting two lines of
text when the document loads. Because the change occurs as the document
is first loaded, you are not aware that an action is being performed.
Nevertheless, this is a dynamic event, and not a static rendering of
text as you see in standard HTML. For a more dynamic example of how
JavaScript can change the appearance of a page, see the next section,
called Insert Adjacent HTML.</p>

<p>NOTE: <em>It is important to understand that the text you see above is not
the actual code that gets executed. The real code is inside this HTML
page, but hidden from view. Whenever you include an angle bracket: \&lt;>
in your HTML, then the words inside those brackets are called a tag, and
they become hidden from view when the page is rendered in a browser. In
this case, all the words between the opening \<script\> and closing
\</script\> tags are considered part of the script tag, and are hidden
from view. To show an angle bracket to the reader of an HTML page, you
write the following code: <strong>\&lt;</strong> or <strong>></strong>. The first bit of code is an
open angle bracket, and the second a close angle bracket. HTML is pretty
simple and straight forward most of the time, but this is one of those
places where it can be a bit hard to understand what is going on if you
are a newcomer. Nothing will better help you grasp these concepts than
actually getting your hands dirty and writing some code. Sometimes you
can learn best by doing.</em></p>

<p>Good books to read on JavaScript.</p>
<ul>
<li>The gold standard is <strong>JavaScript the Good Parts</strong> by Douglas Crockford. It is a tough read, but it is the pivotal book about JavaScript that taught everyone how to properly use the language.</li>
<li><strong>Maintainable JavaScript</strong>, by Nikalas Zakas, the author of <strong>JavaScript for Web Developers</strong>. MJ is a short book that is easier to read than JGP, but which follows much of the advice found in Crockford&#39;s book.</li>
<li><strong>Secrets of the JavaScript Ninjas</strong> by jQuery&#39;s John Resig is an excellent book. A bit heavy going in places, but full of excellent advice.</li>
<li><strong>Eloquent JavaScript</strong>: An in depth look at the language available <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">on the internet</a>.</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript, the Definitive Guide</strong> by David Flanagan. Considered <em>the</em> book on JavaScript by many.</li>
<li><strong>The Principles of Object Oriented JavaScript</strong> by Nikalas Zakas. If you wish JavaScript were C#.... Includes numerous insights into how JavaScript is structured. I couldn&#39;t put it down.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also want to read <strong>JavaScript Patterns</strong> by Stoyan Stefanov and I am currently reading <strong>Functional JavaScript</strong>. The latter book is very good, but perhaps too advanced for most of us.</p>
