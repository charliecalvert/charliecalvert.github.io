<h2 id="google-site-insert-html">Google Site Insert HTML</h2>
<p>To insert HTML into a page on Google Sites:</p>
<ul>
<li>First put your page in edit mode</li>
<li>Then go to the top of the page where you have icons for editing your content</li>
<li>Click the little HTML icon</li>
<li>Paste in your text and click the Update button.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="markdown-tips">Markdown Tips</h2>
<p>Here is how to put text between images in a markdown document. Notice that there is an empty line between each of these elements:</p>
<p>Text 1</p>
<pre><code>    [Text](ImageURL)</code></pre>
<p>Text 2</p>
<pre><code>    [Text](ImageURL)</code></pre>
<p>Text 3</p>
<pre><code>    [Text](ImageURL)</code></pre>
<p>Here is an <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/elvenware/home/prog270/testimagepage">Example page</a>.</p>
<p>Here is how to add titles to images in markdown:</p>
<pre><code>![alt](url &quot;title&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Reference:</p>

<h2 id="online">Online</h2>
<p>There will be two assignments this week.</p>
<h3 id="assignment-01">Assignment 01</h3>
<p>We are going to begin serving up our own HTML pages so we can learn how to craft them to work with mobile devices. To do this, we will use two technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cloud 9 IDE</li>
<li>NodeJs</li>
</ul>
<p>When we worked on Google Sites (and we are not done with Google Sites) we simply checked a button the config page to make our pages work with mobile sites. In particular, we choose:</p>
<ul>
<li>More from the menu</li>
<li>Manage Site</li>
<li>Then checked: &quot;Automatically Adjust site to Mobile Phones&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>But how is that done? Exactly what makes a page work on a mobile phone?</p>
<p>A page can &quot;look wrong&quot; on a mobile device in various ways. For instance, consider this picture:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../Images/MobileLook01.png" alt="Bad Image" /><figcaption>Bad Image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It doesn't look very nice because the fonts are outsized. Now look at these pictures:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../Images/MobileLook02.png" alt="Good Image" /><figcaption>Good Image</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
<img src="../Images/MobileLook03.png" alt="Good Image" /><figcaption>Good Image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Both of these latter images look better than the first picture. In particular, their fonts are in the right proportion to the page.</p>
<p>It turns out that it is simple to convert a normal HTML page to one that will work in a mobile browser. At least in some cases it can be simple. Perhaps not always, but sometimes. For instance, with the page shown above, all I had to do was add the following code to it:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>For now, let's not spend a lot of time thinking about what that code does on a technical level. It is enough to simply say that it automatically scales the page to the appropriate size for the phone. You can think of the <strong>initial-scale</strong> attribute like a &quot;zoom&quot; property. We are zoomed to level 1, which is normal size for the device.</p>
<h4 id="setting-up-the-page">Setting up the Page</h4>
<p>If we are going to start adding lines of code to our HTML, then we need to begin having more control over the way a page is rendered than we can get on Google Sites. This is not a problem with Google Sites, which obviously solves all of these problems for us automatically. Rather it is not the right teaching platform for me to show you more details about the syntax of content displayed on mobile devices.</p>
<p>One way to solve this problem would be to take you to a place like Amazon Web Services (AWS). However, I don't want to take that step quite yet. Instead, I'll ask that you create an account on the online IDE called <a href="https://c9.io/">Cloud 9</a>. This site is free to use. Or at least it is free for the kind of simple project we want to create.</p>
<p>It turns, out however, that the simplest way to create an account on Cloud 9 is to &quot;sign in&quot; with a <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> account. We will be using GitHub quite a bit in this course, but for now you can just create your GitHub account, and later we will learn more about that service. So I will ask you first to simply create an account on GitHub and then do nothing special with it other than use it to sign in to Cloud 9. So begin by going to GitHub and creating an account:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Now go to Cloud 9, and sign in using your GitHub account. If you are prompted for a user name and password, they are (most likely) looking for the name and password on your GitHub account. Once you are logged into Cloud 9 you are now ready to get started with this core sections of this assignment.</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> <em>I've been using <a href="https://c9.io/">Cloud 9</a> for a couple years now. I tried to introduce it into class last year, but it was still a bit too funky for that scenario. I think, however, that most of the kinks are now worked out of the core functionality of the site. You may still find it down from to time, but 85% of the time you should find it up and running. Remember: if a site occasionally has some funkiness, then you probably don't want to wait until 11 PM on the night an assignment is due to begin working with the site. Rather, start a few days ahead of time, and if occasionally the site is on the fritz, you can just focus your attention elsewhere for a few minutes, and then switch back when the site is up and running. Life in the cloud is less problematic each year, or even each month. But it is still a bit touch and go at times.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hint:</strong> One trick to consider when using Cloud 9: sometimes the interface is frozen even though the tools on the site are working properly. To update the interface, try signing out and signing back in again. Since you are using GitHub to sign in, you should find this process very easy.</p>
<p>**HInt: You can check on the <a href="https://status.c9.io/">status of Cloud 9</a> to see if there are known problems.</p>
<p>After you sign into Cloud 9, you should go to the DashBoard. On that page, you should push the large green button labelled &quot;Create New Workspace.&quot;</p>
<figure>
<img src="../Images/CloudNine01.png" alt="Create Workspace" /><figcaption>Create Workspace</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When you click the Create Workspace button:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name your workspace Prog270-LastName, where LastName is your last name.</li>
<li>Choose the Hosted solution</li>
<li>Select the NodeJs button</li>
<li>Click <strong>Create</strong></li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="../Images/CloudNine02.png" alt="Start Editing" /><figcaption>Start Editing</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You will have to wait a bit. Perhaps quite a while, as CloudNine is actually spinning up a virtual machine for you, which is a fairly costly operation. So give it at least 5, or perhaps 10 minutes, before giving up. It should work much faster than that, but sometimes things can be slow if the site has a heavy load. Once your VM is up and running, it will start much more quickly the next time.</p>
<p>When your Workspace appears to be ready:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select your workspace</li>
<li>Click on the green <strong>Start Editing</strong> button</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="../Images/CloudNine03.png" alt="Start Editing" /><figcaption>Start Editing</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now create two files in your workspace:</p>
<ul>
<li>An HTML file called <strong>Test01.html</strong> where you will place your converted Markdown and a bit of extra code. Make sure you write the file name, and its case, exactly as shown. It should be <strong>Test01.html</strong>, not <strong>test01.html</strong> or <strong>test01.HTML</strong> or <strong>TeSt01.hTMl</strong> or any other variation. Just <strong>Test01.html</strong>.</li>
<li>You will also need a file called <strong>server.js</strong> that will contain code that I will give you. This file will be created automatically for your by Cloud Nine.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the top of Test01.html paste in this code:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
     &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&quot;&gt;
     &lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;!-- Your converted markdown, now in HTML format, will go here --&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Now go to your favorite markdown editor and create some markdown with at least two images and one list. Convert the markdown to HTML and paste it into your HTML document just below the HTML comment and just above the closing BODY tag:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
     &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&quot;&gt;
     &lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;!-- Your converted markdown, now in HTML format, will go here --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example document with some HTML in it. Your HTML will be
more complex than this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<figure>
<img src="../Images/CloudNine04.png" alt="Edit HTML" /><figcaption>Edit HTML</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li><a href="../Images/CloudNine04.png">Full Size Picture</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Now edit the document called server.js. Replace its content with the following code:</p>
<pre><code>var http = require(&#39;http&#39;);
var url = require(&#39;url&#39;);
var port = process.env.C9_PORT || 1337;
var fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;);

function getPath(request) {
    return url.parse(request.url).pathname;
}

function onRequest(request, response) {
    var pathname = getPath(request);
    console.log(&quot;Request for &quot; + pathname + &quot; received.&quot;);
    response.writeHead(200, {&quot;Content-Type&quot;: &quot;text/plain&quot;});
    response.write(&quot;Hello World&quot;);
    response.end();
}

function first(request, response) {
    var path = getPath(request);
    console.log(&quot;Request for &quot; + path + &quot; received.&quot;);
    if (path === &#39;/Test01.css&#39;) {
        var css = fs.readFileSync(__dirname + path);
        response.writeHead(200, {&#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;text/css&#39;});
        response.write(css);
    } else {
        var html = fs.readFileSync(__dirname + &#39;/Test01.html&#39;);
        response.writeHead(200, {&#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;text/html&#39;});
        response.write(html);
    }
    response.end();
}

http.createServer(first).listen(port);
console.log(&quot;Server has started:&quot; + port);</code></pre>
<figure>
<img src="../Images/CloudNine05.png" alt="Edit server.js" /><figcaption>Edit server.js</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li><a href="../Images/CloudNine05.png">Full Size Picture</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Now you can press the <strong>Run</strong> button. You should receive a notice that your page is running on the Web at a URL that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>Your code is running at &#39;https://prog270-calvert-c9-charliecalvert.c9.io&#39;.</code></pre>
<p>Your URL will look a bit different from this, but it should have at least some elements in common. For instance, it should end with c9.io.</p>
<p>Congratulations! This is a big accomplishment. You have created a real web site with a page that works in a mobile browser. You handled all the code yourself, and created the content of your page.</p>
<h4 id="turn-it-in">Turn it in</h4>
<p>Use your browser to visit the page that you find in your copy of Cloud 9. Take a screenshot of the page. Attach the screen shot to the assignment. If you want, include a picture of your work inside the Cloud 9 editor. It should be possible to set things up so we can see your app running on the right of the editor, and your code on the left side. That would make the best picture to include with your assignment.</p>
<h3 id="assignment-two">Assignment Two</h3>
<p><a href="http://youtu.be/k7Hr22oj7L0">Watch this video on GitHub</a></p>
<p>Create a simple repo in GitHub called Prog270-LastName where lastName is your last name. Your repo should contain a README.md file. Pull your repo to a local machine and add some additional markdown to your README file. Send me the URL of your repo.</p>
