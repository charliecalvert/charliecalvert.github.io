                        <p>An integrated development environment (IDE) can be useful to some <em>web page
                                creators</em>. In this class we will probably use WebStorm or NotePad++.</p>
                        <p>You may choose to spend the entire quarter working in just notepad++. You may also use
                            another
                            environment such as Sublime Text, Aptana, Webstorm, Dreamweaver, Visual Studio Code,
                            Brackets, or
                            any number of programs out there.</p>
                        <p>My tool of choice is WebStorm. If you have no preferance, that will probably prove the
                            simplest
                            choice for you.</p>

                        best place
                        to start is by calling them at 425-564-2200 or check the website at <a href="http://bellevuecollege.edu/asc/tutoring">http://bellevuecollege.edu/asc/tutoring</a>.

                        consult a
                        fellow student, the book. and the syllabus. In general, my policy is to allow each student to
                        miss one
                        class without comment. If you miss multiple classes then my sympathy for any potential
                        hardships you may
                        encounter might be affected. I am not heartless, but I'm prejudice in favor of students who
                        attend class
                        regularly.
