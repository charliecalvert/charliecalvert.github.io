<h2>Everyone Can Write Code</h2>
<p>It is easy to buy into the false idea that some people have the skills to be a good programmer and others do not.</p>
<p>If you are born with bad eyesight, then you will always have bad eyesight. (I know about glasses and laser surgery, but give me some latitude in the analogy.) The reaction time you have by age 20 is probably the reaction time you will have all your life. You can&#39;t change those things.</p>
<p>But there are other skills. For instance, the ability to walk 25 miles every day. Almost everyone can learn to walk 25 miles a day if they just work at it. For some it will be easy to learn, for others harder. But almost everyone can do it.</p>
<p>Programming is the same way. It is not a fixed ability like eyesight or reaction time, it is an ability we can cultivate through daily effort. If you start walking 2, 3 or 5 miles a day for a week, then move up to 7, 8 and 10, and then to 15 and finally to 20 or 25, you will learn to walk a long way every day without too much effort. The same with writing code. If you work at it, you will get good at it.</p>
<p>Learning to talk, read and write is really hard. But nearly everyone learns how to do it. Some pick it up quickly, others slowly. But nearly everyone can learn to speak, read and write. The same with coding. You can learn. Just work at it.</p>
<p>And some will say, &quot;Oh no, you don&#39;t understand. I just don&#39;t have the skills to write code.&quot; To which I reply: &quot;Oh, maybe. But it is not very likely. If you are a healthy adult or teenager then you can learn to code. There are some people who can&#39;t learn, but these people are a very small minority. Anyone who graduates from High School can learn.&quot;</p>

<h2>Positive</h2>
<p>If we want to achieve your goals, work on maintaining a positive attitude. There will always be problems any place you work. Both the people around you, and you yourself, will always have flaws and make mistakes. The key to success is to know this, accept it, and rise above it. Contribute what you can with enthusiasm and open cooperation. Accept the bad stuff. You will find it manifests itself both in your own actions and in the actions of your fellow employees and managers. The bad stuff is simply part of the price of earning a living and working with others.</p>
<p>Develop a strong, fighting attitude. Be tough and don&#39;t give up. You may have reasonably good technical skills, but you will still have to work on polishing and refining them. Tech is not easy, and we have to give 100% if we want to have real success.</p>
