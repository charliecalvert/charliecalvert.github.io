<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>I tend to publish a lot of links in assignments and in overview documents. It is generally not necessary to read all the content referenced by these links, however  it is usually a good idea to click on most of these links and at least scan the first few paragraphs, just to make sure you understanding what information is available.</p>
<p>Some of these links go to very long, and often not particularly well organized, documents. Nevertheless, it is nice to at least know that there is an <a href="http://www.elvenware.com/">Elvenware</a> section that discusses <a href="http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/development/git/">Git</a>, and to note that it consists of documents which in their turn link to other valuable resources.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t have a book, so you have no reading to do each week. But that doesn&#39;t mean you are completely off the hook in terms of doing a little reading outside of class. I&#39;m not saying you should dedicate five or six hours to trying to read everything I link to, but dedicating 20 or 30 minutes to exploring some of the links is likely to be valuable.</p>
<p>For instance, every once in awhile, around week five or six, in the discussion area, someone will suddenly discover the Git book. &quot;&#39;Look what I found&#39;, they say. &#39;A free online book about git.&#39;&quot; But if they had spent two minutes with the Git page on Elvenware, they would have known about the book from week one.</p>
<p>This is far from a perfect system, and you are not graded on the number of links you explore. But I do put them there in the hopes that they will help you succeed.</p>
