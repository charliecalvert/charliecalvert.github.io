<h1>Cloud 9 Intro</h1>
<p>Cloud 9 is free if you get an invitation from me. I pay $1 a month to run an education account, which means that I can let as many students in as I wish.</p>
<p>When you get the invitation, click on the link provided.</p>
<p>Sign into Cloud 9 and set up a workspace based on your repository. Typically, your repository will have a name like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>prog219-lastname-2016</strong></li>
<li><strong>prog272-lastname-2016</strong></li>
<li><strong>isit320-lastname-2016</strong></li>
<li>etc...</li>
</ul>
<p>Use this as a guide:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://bit.ly/elf-cloud9">Cloud 9 Slides</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Our primary goal in this exercise is to create a Cloud Nine environment in which:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>JsObjects</strong> has been cloned and is available to us</li>
<li>We have set up customized <strong>.bashrc</strong> and <strong>.bash_aliases</strong> files.<ul>
<li>This includes setting up our path and other environment variables</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We have a pre-configured <strong>bin</strong> directory with useful scripts in it.</li>
<li>Have certain Npm global packages installed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Near the bottom of this file I include a [minimum install][#minimum-install] that you can perform if you don&#39;t want to set up your environment as outlined in the body of this document. For most students, it is much better to do a regular setup than to use the minimum install.</p>
<a class="anchor" id="create-workspace"></a>
<h2>Create Workspace</h2>
<p>If you have not done so already,</p>
<ul>
<li>In Cloud 9 hit the Plus icon and create<ul>
<li>new nodejs workspace</li>
<li>Based on your repository</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a class="anchor" id="install-jsobjects"></a>
<h2>Install JsObjects</h2>
<p>JsObjects is the ancient, messy repository where I keep example code and many utilities that I use all the time. These utilities automate many tasks, and simplify navigation at the command prompt. You don&#39;t have to install JsObjects to code on Cloud9, however, I prefer to have it installed as it helps me simplify many tasks. Since I will have it installed, you should also consider installing it or you may find that it is difficult to follow the steps I take in class.</p>
<p>In your Cloud 9 workspace, navigate to your home directory. Create a folder called <strong>~/Git</strong> and navigate into it::</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-keyword">cd</span>
mkdir ~<span class="hljs-string">/Git</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">cd</span> ~<span class="hljs-string">/Git</span>
</code></pre><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <em>In Cloud 9, just type CTRL-V to paste your code into the bash shell.</em></p>
<p>The code shown above is a bit redundant in that I have already asked you to navigate to your home directory. Hence, the following code would work if you are carefully following my directions:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-keyword">cd</span>         <span class="hljs-comment">// Don't use this example. Instead, play</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">mkdir</span> Git  <span class="hljs-comment">// it safe with the example above:</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">cd</span> Git     <span class="hljs-comment">// "mkdir ~/Git &amp;&amp; cd ~/Git"</span>
</code></pre><p>Notice that in this second set of commands I am not including the code that points at our home directory: <strong>~/.</strong>. Nevertheless, in the first example, I do include it, just to be safe. Thus, if a student forgets to first navigate to the home directory, then the commands will still work. Of course, some students will no doubt cut and paste the last two lines of the second example and use it in the wrong place. One can&#39;t win. But I can try to point you in the right direction.</p>
<a class="anchor" id="clone-jsobjects"></a>
<h2>Clone JsObjects</h2>
<p>Clone <a href="jsobjects">JsObjects</a> into <strong>~/Git</strong></p>
<pre><code>cd ~/Git
git <span class="hljs-keyword">clone</span> <span class="hljs-title">https</span>://github.com/charliecalvert/JsObjects.git
</code></pre><p>Again, the code above is a bit redundant, as I have already asked you to navigate into the <strong>~/Git</strong> directory. However, one cannot be too careful.</p>
<a class="anchor" id="set-up-bash_aliases"></a>
<h2>Set up .bash_aliases</h2>
<p>Many of the shortcut commands that I use all the time are stored in the <strong>.bash_aliases</strong> file stored in my JsObjects repository. Let&#39;s back up the default cloud 9 <strong>.bash_aliases</strong> file, copy in my version of the file, and process it so that we can immediately begin using aliases and exports defined in that file:</p>
<pre><code>cp ~/<span class="hljs-selector-class">.bash_aliases</span> ~/<span class="hljs-selector-class">.bash_aliases</span><span class="hljs-selector-class">.c9</span>
cp ~/Git/JsObjects/Utilities/SetupLinuxBox/<span class="hljs-selector-class">.bash_aliases</span> ~/.
source ~/.bash_aliases
</code></pre><a class="anchor" id="understanding-bashrc"></a>
<h2>Understanding .bashrc</h2>
<p>The <strong>.bashrc</strong> file is located in your home directory. It is processed when you open a bash shell or when you run one of these commands:</p>
<pre><code>source ~<span class="hljs-string">/.bashrc</span>
. ~<span class="hljs-string">./bashrc</span>
</code></pre><p>The second command is a period followed by the path to your <strong>.bashrc</strong> file.</p>
<p>The <strong>.bashrc</strong> contains a series of commands that help to set up the bash environment. It is your chance to customize the environment to suit your needs. You can also review the file to help you understand how bash works.</p>
<p>You can most easily find the .bashrc file in your Cloud 9 editor by following these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the menu item <strong>Window | Workspace</strong> is selected</li>
<li>Toggle open the <strong>workspace</strong> tab on the far left.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>gear</strong> icon</li>
<li>Select <strong>Show home in favorites</strong></li>
<li>Ensure that <strong>Show hidden files</strong> is selected</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you should be able to view your entire directory tree in the <strong>workspace</strong> window. This is useful when you want to edit your <strong>.bashrc</strong> or other configuration files such as <strong>.bash_aliases</strong>. However, much of the time it is just a distraction, and can be turned off.</p>
<a class="anchor" id="configure-bashrc"></a>
<h2>Configure .bashrc</h2>
<p>There are a few commands you should run to set up node to work the way we prefer. Begin by running the following in the bash shell:</p>
<pre><code>npm<span class="hljs-built_in"> config </span><span class="hljs-builtin-name">set</span><span class="hljs-built_in"> prefix </span>~/npm
</code></pre><p>This command tells <strong>npm</strong> to place your globally installed packages in your home directory, in a folder called <strong>npm</strong>. This is useful for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you install an NPM library into the default space, then it is owned by root. This means you need to type sudo in order to work with that library. Sometimes that doesn&#39;t matter, but sometimes it means that you end up needing to type sudo in order to work with your application. Soon, you end up in a mess, where you can&#39;t run your own program without first giving it root permissions. This won&#39;t happen all the time, but it is simpler to avoid the whole issue by installing your npm libraries someplace where you have permissions to use them.</li>
<li>This second point can be argued either way. If you install your NPM global libraries in a place where only you can see them, then you will not pollute other user&#39;s environment. On the other hand, some libraries will be installed multiple times.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bottom line is that one does not have to install NPM libraries into your home directory, but it is safer, particularly for beginners, to do so.</p>
<p>Check out this file: ~/Git/JsObjects/Utilities/SetupLinuxBox/BashrcEasyExtras</p>
<p>Put at least portions of it at the end of your <strong>~/.bashrc</strong>. The sinplest way to do this is as follows:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-symbol">slb</span>
<span class="hljs-symbol">cat</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">BashrcEasyExtras </span>&gt;&gt; ~/.<span class="hljs-keyword">bashrc
</span><span class="hljs-symbol">source</span> ~/.<span class="hljs-keyword">bashrc</span>
</code></pre><p>The first command, <strong>slb</strong>, is from our <strong>~/.bash_aliases</strong> file. It won&#39;t work unless you have set up <strong>~/.bash_aliases</strong> as described above. The <strong>slb</strong> alias moves you to this directory:</p>
<p><strong>~/Git/JsObjects/Utilities/SetupLinuxBox</strong></p>
<p>The second command appends some text onto the end of your <strong>~/.bashrc</strong> file. The text is found in a file from JsObjects called <strong>BashrcEasyExtras</strong>. We then process the <strong>~/.bashrc</strong>.</p>
<p>Optionally, we can display some of the work we did to confirm that everything is set up as expected:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-built_in">echo</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$NODE_PATH</span>
<span class="hljs-built_in">echo</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$PATH</span>
</code></pre><p>If you want, you can edit your ~/.bashrc file manually. For instance, you can append the following to the end of the file:</p>
<pre>
if [ -z "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ] ; then
    eval `ssh-agent`
fi

export NODE_PATH=$HOME/npm/lib/node_modules
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/npm/bin"
</pre>

<p>Then run <strong>source ~/.bashrc</strong>.</p>
<a class="anchor" id="the-gitignore-file"></a>
<h2>The .gitignore file</h2>
<p>Make sure that your repository contains a <strong>.gitignore</strong> file with a section that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-comment"># IDE Files</span>
<span class="hljs-string">.idea</span>
<span class="hljs-string">.c9</span>
</code></pre><a class="anchor" id="screen-shots"></a>
<h2>Screen Shots</h2>
<p>Take a screen shot displaying the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The root file system from the Project page on left</li>
<li><strong>Control.js</strong> from the JasmineExpress project open in the editor.</li>
<li>Your JasmineExpress project running in a terminal</li>
<li>The intereface of your project in a preview window</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>It really doesn&#39;t matter much to me which project you show in Cloud9. If for some reason you don&#39;t have JasmineExpress up and running, just choose a different a project.</em></p>
<p>The screenshot you want to create will be similar to, but not identical too, the image shown below:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket01.elvenware.com/images/Cloud9Intro01.png"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket01.elvenware.com/images/Cloud9IntroSmall01.png" alt="Cloud9Small"></a></p>
<p><strong>Image01</strong>: <em>The Cloud 9 IDE. Click the image above to expand it.</em></p>
<a class="anchor" id="webpack-on-cloud-9"></a>
<h2>Webpack on Cloud 9</h2>
<p>Place the properties called <strong>build</strong>, <strong>c9</strong> and <strong>c9a</strong> in the <strong>scripts</strong> object of your <strong>package.json</strong> file.</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-string">"scripts"</span>: {
   <span class="hljs-string">"start"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server"</span>,
   <span class="hljs-string">"build"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"node_modules/.bin/webpack"</span>,
   <span class="hljs-string">"c9"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server --host <span class="hljs-variable">$IP</span> --port <span class="hljs-variable">$PORT</span>"</span>,
   <span class="hljs-string">"c9a"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server --host <span class="hljs-variable">$IP</span> --port <span class="hljs-variable">$PORT</span> --hot --inline"</span>
 },
</code></pre><p><a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/230">Webpack on Cloud 9</a></p>
<a class="anchor" id="turn-it-in"></a>
<h2>Turn it in</h2>
<p>Submit your work and attach the screenshots.</p>
<a class="anchor" id="install-node-manually"></a>
<h2>Install Node Manually</h2>
<p>Node should already be installed in your copy of Cloud9. In fact, <strong>NVM</strong> should also be installed, so you can set the current version of Node with that tool, if you know how to use it.</p>
<p>However, if you want to take over control -- and I can&#39;t think of a good reason why you should -- then you can do this:</p>
<pre>
jou
cd NodeInstall
$ ./InstallNodePackages.sh
</pre>

<p>Just to be clear, <strong>InsteallNodePackages.sh</strong> is in this location:</p>
<pre>
~/Git/JsObjects/Utilities/NodeInstall
</pre>

<p>Now you should be okay to get started.</p>
<a class="anchor" id="minimum-install"></a>
<h2>Minimum Install</h2>
<p>For the vast majority of students, performing the minimum steps instead of the full environment setup will not save you time. You will indeed get set up faster, but then, throughout the quarter, you will often have to take extra steps that I and the other students in the class don&#39;t need to take. In the long run, it will likely take you much longer to do the minimum install than to properly set up your environment. But I want you to have the choice to do things your own way -- even if it costs you egregiously -- if that is what you prefer. Also, in a very few cases, an expert student might have their own system for handling the tasks that I automate. In that case, they need not do the full environment setup that I prefer.</p>
<p>For those who want only the minimum install, start from the bash shell, and run the following:</p>
<pre><code>npm<span class="hljs-built_in"> config </span><span class="hljs-builtin-name">set</span><span class="hljs-built_in"> prefix </span>~/npm
</code></pre><p>Also, at the bottom of your <strong>~/.bashrc</strong> file, add the following lines:</p>
<pre><code>export PATH=<span class="hljs-string">"$PATH:$HOME/npm/bin:"</span>
export NODE_PATH=:$HOME/npm/<span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">lib</span>/<span class="hljs-title">node_modules</span></span>
</code></pre><p>This adds the <strong>~/npm/bin</strong> directory to your path. After adding the line, either restart your shell, or type the following:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-built_in">source</span> ~/.bashrc
</code></pre><p>This processes the changes to your <strong>.bashrc</strong> file.</p>
<p>This is the end of the minimum install.</p>
