<h1 id="google-drive-files-and-folders">Google Drive Files and Folders</h1>
<p>This assignment is designed to help you become familiar with creating folders and files on Google Drive.</p>
<h2 id="justification">Justification</h2>
<p>I've been teaching Google Drive to students for a number of years now. I began by giving students an assignment like our <strong>Online Pressence</strong> exercise. My thinking was that Google Drive was not particularly hard to use, and once students got used to it, they would be comfortable with it. Then later in the course, I would ask, for one reason or another, for students to submit documents on Google Drive, SkyDrive or Evernote. To my surprise, I found that many could not complete the assignment on the first try. In other words, they weren't learning how to use these tools from a single assignment. Now that I think about it, this should have been obvious to me from the first.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, I was noticing that my own use of Google Drive and other tools kept increasing quarter by quarter. At first, that might seem like a good sign, but it is also the pattern that one follows when still learning how to use a tool. In other words, I used the tool more as I became more comfortable with it, more familiar with it.</p>
<p>So the goal of this assignment, and subsequent assignments, will be to be sure that we are all familiar with Google Drive, SkyDrive, Evernote and similar tools. I'm going to ask you to use them enough so that they become second nature to you.</p>
<p>Our data belongs in the cloud. I has to be in the cloud. There is no other place to put it where we can reach it easily from all our devices. If our data is going to be in the cloud, then we have to be on speaking terms with the tools available in the cloud.</p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>Become familiar with working with files and folders in Google Drive</li>
<li>Learn that a single file and folder can be in more than location on Google Drive</li>
</ul>
<p>Many clearly services are virtual tools designed to mimic real world objects. We are not actually placing files in folders on a drive. We are working with virtual folders, and virtual drives. Hence we can do things that are not easy to do on a normal file system. For instance, we can make files and folders appear to be in two locations. (Linux actually makes this trick fairly easy. It can also be done in Windows, but there are caveats on a Windows OS that make it such links less than completely useful.)</p>
<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<p>Here's the assignment:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create a folder called Prog280-Week02 inside the Google Drive folder you have already shared with me.</li>
<li>Create a Google Document, Spreadsheet(Sheet01) and Presentation(Deck01) inside that folder.</li>
<li>Name the Document Doc01, the SpreadSheet Sheet01 and the Presentation Deck01.</li>
<li>Create two folders called Folder01 and Folder02.</li>
<li>The document and spreadsheet should be in the following folders: Prog280-Week02 and Folder01.</li>
<li>The presentation should be in Prog280-Week02 and Folder02</li>
<li>A document called Folder01Overview should be in Folder01.</li>
<li>A document called Folder02Overview should be in Folder02.</li>
<li>Each file in your folder should have one line of text in it: &quot;This is Doc01&quot;, &quot;This is Deck01&quot;, etc.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>    * Prog280-LastName
        Doc01
        Sheet01
        Deck01
        * Folder01
            Folder01Overview
            Doc01
            Sheet01
        * Folder02
            Folder02Overview
            Deck01</code></pre>
<p>It is important to understand there should be only one copy of <strong>Doc01</strong>, <strong>Sheet01</strong>, and <strong>Deck01</strong>.</p>
<p>To place a document in one folder, simply navigate to that folder and create the document inside it. To place it in two folders, or to move it from one folder to another, put a check mark in front of the file or folder, then click the <strong>Move To</strong> icon, which is shaped like a folder, and which is located near the top of Google Drive window.</p>

<p>If you hold down the Ctrl key, and click with the left mouse button, then you can place a document or folder in more than one location.</p>

<h2 id="turn-it-in">Turn it In</h2>
<p>When you are done with the assignment, simply submit the URL of your Google Drive. I can then find your files and folders and check that you have completed the assignment correctly.</p>
