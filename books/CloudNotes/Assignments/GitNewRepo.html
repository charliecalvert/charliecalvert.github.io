<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This assignment is designed to help you create a new Git repository. The text covers both <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a>. If possible, you should prefer GitHub since it plays a central role in web development. GitHub is <em>the</em> central repository for code related to web development.</p>
<p>Since my students turn in assignments with Git, in some, but not all, cases it is important that their repositories be private. Free private repositories are readily available on GitHub if you sign up for the <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">Student Pack</a>. BitBucket also provides free private repositories.  </p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <em>Since this document covers both GitHub and Bitbucket, you should proceed with caution. Take care to distinguish between the instructions for the two sites. Note that Git itself is an open source project entirely separate from either GitHub or BitBucket. Git is Git no matter where it is. Nevertheless, the websites for Bitbucket and GitHub have differences, so proceed with caution.</em></p>
<p>I assume the user is running on Linux, but it would not be hard to follow along if you are using Windows. Again, you should prefer Linux as it, and <strong>macOS</strong>, are the primary platforms for Web development. Windows is a good platform for Web development, but the leaders in Web development tend to use macOS and Linux as their development platforms.</p>

<h2>Configure Git</h2>
<p>After installing Git, there are few steps you need to take to set it up. It is perhaps simplest to get these chores out of the way at the very start. Your goals will be to tell Git:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your username</li>
<li>Your email address</li>
<li>Your preferred style to use when pushing data to the cloud.</li>
</ul>
<p>Issue these commands, editing as appropriate:</p>
<pre><code>git config --global user<span class="hljs-selector-class">.name</span> <span class="hljs-string">"charlie at school"</span>
git config --global user<span class="hljs-selector-class">.email</span> <span class="hljs-string">"noone@nowhere.net"</span>
git config --global push<span class="hljs-selector-class">.default</span> simple
</code></pre><p>These commands are stored in your Git config file, usually found here <strong>~/.gitconfig</strong>. You can see the contents of the file by issuing this command:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-built_in">cat</span> ~/.gitconfig
</code></pre><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <em>Remember that the tilda (~) is a shorthand for your HOME directory. I should add that I&#39;m oversimplifying a bit here. Learn more about the the config files <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup">here</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <em>Since I am usually not sharing my repository with a large number of users, I tend to use the name to identify the location from which I am working. For instance <strong>charlie at home</strong>, <strong>charlie at school</strong>, <strong>charlie on his laptop</strong> etc. This is more than a bit quirky, and might not be at all appropriate in a corporate setting, but I nevertheless find it occasionally useful to know where I was when I did some work.</em></p>
<a class="anchor" id="clone-repo"></a>
<h2>Clone an Existing Repository</h2>
<p>This assignment is designed to help your create a new repository from scratch. Sometimes students try to use it as a guide for cloning an existing repository, but I would not recommending doing that. If you already have a repository in <strong>GitHub</strong> or <strong>BitBucket</strong> you can get a local copy of that repository by cloning it:</p>
<pre>
git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
git clone git@bitbucket.org:USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
</pre>

<p>In most cases, I call <strong>git clone</strong> from my <strong>~/Git</strong> folder:</p>
<pre>
cd ~/Git
git clone git@bitbucket.org:ccalvert/deleteme06.git
Cloning into 'deleteme06'...
remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
Receiving objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
</pre>

<p>Now that we understand what to do with an existing repositories, lets go back to our current task, which is setting up a new repository.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <em>On GitHub, it is possible to create a repository with a pre-initialized <strong>README.md</strong> file. If you do that, then you need do nothing more than clone the repository you created on GitHub site. In other words, much of what follows is unnecessary, particularly the bits about <strong>git remote add origin...</strong>.</em></p>
<a class="anchor" id="git-account-github"></a>
<h2>Git Account GitHub</h2>
<p>Use <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> to host your <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">Git</a> repository. You have two choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new GitHub account if you don&#39;t have one already</li>
<li>Use an existing GitHub account.</li>
<li>Sign up for the Github <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">student pack</a><ul>
<li>The student pack might take a few days to set up, but I believe the delay is shorter than it used to be.</li>
<li>Even though there is a delay, apply anyway.</li>
<li>With the student pack you can create private repositories for free.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a class="anchor" id="git-account-bitbucket"></a>
<h2>Git Account BitBucket</h2>
<p>Use <a href="https://bitbucket.org">BitBucket</a> to host a private <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">Git</a> repository. You have two choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new BitBucket account if you don&#39;t have one already</li>
<li>Use an existing BitBucket account.</li>
</ul>
<a class="anchor" id="create-home"></a>
<h2>Create Repo Home</h2>
<p>In GitHub or BitBucket, from the home page, create a new repository:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose the <strong>Create</strong> or <strong>New Repository</strong> menu item near the top</li>
<li>Select <strong>Create Repository</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Name your Git repository like this, where <strong>isit320</strong> should be name of your class:</p>
<pre><code>isit320_lastname-<span class="hljs-built_in">year</span>
</code></pre><p>For instance, your repository might have a name like one of the following, depending
on the class you are in and the current year:</p>
<pre><code>prog219-calvert<span class="hljs-number">-2017</span>
prog270-calvert<span class="hljs-number">-2017</span>
prog272-calvert<span class="hljs-number">-2017</span>
isit320-calvert<span class="hljs-number">-2017</span>
isit322-calvert<span class="hljs-number">-2017</span>
</code></pre><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <em>Throughout this and similar documents, the year field should be set to the current year. I may have written or last updated this document one or more years ago, but you should use your common sense when using the year field. If it is 2016, then set the year to 2016, even if my example uses some other year.</em></p>
<p>Then make the following selections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set the Type: Git</li>
<li>Initialize with a <strong>README</strong> or <strong>.gitignore</strong>. (GitHub only)<ul>
<li>If you choose this option, then you can simply clone your repository after creating it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set the Project options: Wiki, IssueTracking (Bitbucket only)</li>
<li>Set the Language: JavaScript (BitBucket only)</li>
</ul>
<a class="anchor" id="share"></a>
<h2>Share Repository</h2>
<p>Make sure you give me <em>read/write</em> access to your repository.</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub: Choose the gear icon near top on right. Select <strong>collaborators</strong> page. My GitHub user name is <strong>charliecalvert</strong>.</li>
<li>Bitbucket: Use the <strong>send invitation</strong> link and use <strong>ccalvert</strong> as my id. You can select it from a dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<a class="anchor" id="git-urls"></a>
<h2>Git URLs</h2>
<p>You can read about Git URLs on Elvenware:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/development/cloud/Git.html#git-urls-and-ssh">Git URLs and SSH</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/development/cloud/Git.html#find-change-url">Finding and Changing URLs</a></li>
</ul>
<a class="anchor" id="ssh"></a>
<h2>Setup SSH</h2>
<p>Make sure SSH is installed. Pristine Lubuntu should have it installed,
but just in case, or if for some reason you need to install it, here
is the command:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-<span class="hljs-keyword">get</span> install ssh
</code></pre><p>It won&#39;t hurt to run the command if SSH is already installed.</p>
<p>At the Linux command prompt Issue these commands, where the first command takes you to your home directory:</p>
<pre><code>cd
ssh-keygen -t rsa -P <span class="hljs-string">''</span> -f ~<span class="hljs-regexp">/.ssh/id</span>_rsa
cat ~<span class="hljs-regexp">/.ssh/id</span>_rsa.pub <span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt; </span>~<span class="hljs-regexp">/.ssh/authorized</span>_keys
</code></pre><p>Now copy your public key into the BitBucket SSH page. The first step will be to copy the key to your clipboard. Begin by navigating into the hidden <strong>.ssh</strong> directory created in the previous step.</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-built_in">cd</span> ~/.ssh
</code></pre><p>We now need to block copy the key to the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=clipboard+computer">clipboard</a>. It might be enough to simply echo the key to your bash shell, and then copy it with the mouse or keyboard:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-selector-tag">cat</span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag">id_rsa</span><span class="hljs-selector-class">.pub</span>
</code></pre><p>An alternative might be to open the key in <strong>geany</strong> or some other text editor, and then select it in the editor with <strong>Ctrl-A</strong> and copy it with <strong>Ctrl-C</strong>. In any case, be sure you have the key saved to your clipboard.</p>
<p>Then in BitBucket:</p>
<ul>
<li>At upper right of page select your image</li>
<li>Choose : Manage Account | SSH Keys | Add Key</li>
<li>Paste in your public key and press save</li>
</ul>
<a class="anchor" id="load-ssh-key"></a>
<h2>Load SSH Key</h2>
<p>Right now your private key is called <strong>id_rsa</strong> and your public key is called <strong>id_rsa.pub</strong>. You might consider renaming them to something more meaningful:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">mv ~<span class="hljs-regexp">/.ssh/i</span>d_rsa ~<span class="hljs-regexp">/.ssh/</span>Prog270-Fall-<span class="hljs-number">2016</span>
mv ~<span class="hljs-regexp">/.ssh/i</span>d_rsa.pub ~<span class="hljs-regexp">/.ssh/</span>Prog270-Fall-<span class="hljs-number">2016</span>.pub
</code></pre>
<p>At this point, you should be able to load your SSH private key into memory:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">ssh-<span class="hljs-keyword">add</span><span class="bash"> ~/.ssh/Isit320-Fall-2015</span>
</code></pre>
<p>If this works as expected, you should see the words <strong>Identity added</strong> in the response:</p>
<pre><code>ssh-add <span class="hljs-regexp">~/.ssh/</span>Prog270-Fall<span class="hljs-number">-2016</span>
Identity <span class="hljs-string">added:</span> <span class="hljs-regexp">/home/</span>charliecalvert<span class="hljs-regexp">/.ssh/</span>Prog270-Fall<span class="hljs-number">-2016</span> (rsa w/o comment)
</code></pre><p>At this point, you are all set to begin pushing and pulling data from your repository, as described below.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <em>I should have already added this code for you, but if you have trouble with ssh-add, make sure this code that loads ssh-agent is found near the bottom of your /home/username/.bashrc file:</em></p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> [ -z <span class="hljs-string">"<span class="hljs-variable">$SSH_AUTH_SOCK</span>"</span> ] ; <span class="hljs-keyword">then</span>
    <span class="hljs-built_in">eval</span> `ssh-agent`
<span class="hljs-keyword">fi</span>
</code></pre><p>You will need to load your SSH key with <strong>ssh-add</strong> each time your start a new bash (command line) session. Or at least you will need to do so each time you reboot lubuntu.</p>
<pre><code>ssh-<span class="hljs-keyword">add</span><span class="bash"> ~/.ssh/Prog270-Fall-2016</span>
</code></pre><p>When you want to connect to a remote machine using SSH, you have to specify which private key to use, or at least the location of your private keys. If you get a <strong>permission denied</strong> message, this is likely because:</p>
<ul>
<li>You don&#39;t have the private key on your machine that matches the public key on the server you want to access</li>
<li>You have not given you public key to the site you want to access</li>
<li>Or, if you do have the key, and its public key is installed in the authorized_keys file on the server you want to access, then you have not made the private key accessible on your local machine.</li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases, it is the third of these problems that causes students trouble. A simple way to make a private key accessible is to use <strong>ssh-add</strong> to register it with a program called <strong>ssh-agent</strong>. Then, when you try to access a remote site, all the keys registered with the <strong>ssh-agent</strong> are tried, and if one of them matches, you are golden.</p>
<a class="anchor" id="automating-the-load-process"></a>
<h2>Automating the load process</h2>
<p>If you don&#39;t want to perform this task manually, you could add the following code at the bottom of your <strong>~/.bashrc</strong> file:</p>
<pre><code>ssh-<span class="hljs-keyword">add</span><span class="bash"> ~/.ssh/Prog270-Fall-2016</span>
</code></pre><p>To add the line, open your <strong>~/.bashrc</strong> file in either nano or geany. For instance:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-attribute">geany</span> ~/.bashrc
</code></pre><p>Adding this line is guarrenteed to load your private key for you because your <strong>.bashrc</strong> is processed each time you open the bash shell (command line). If you ever want to manually load your <strong>.bashrc</strong> file, you can execute this code:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-built_in">source</span> ~/.bashrc
</code></pre><p>To learn more, search for the Linux <strong>source</strong> command with Google.</p>
<p>Alternatively, I have created an alias in our <strong>.bash_aliases</strong> file called <strong>sshadd</strong>. (Not <strong>ssh-add</strong> but <strong>sshadd</strong>.) It depends on a symbolic link that you must create in your <strong>~/.ssh</strong> directory. Create the link like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash"><span class="hljs-built_in">cd</span> ~/.ssh
ln <span class="hljs-_">-s</span> Prog270-Fall-2016 main-key
</code></pre>
<p>Where Isit320-Fall-2016 is the name of the private key you want to load when you type <strong>sshadd</strong>. This second approach means you can easily load the key at any time. This is perhaps better than loading it automatically each time you start a new bash shell instance. In particular, if you load it in your bashrc, then you might end up with multiple instances of it running. If you load it by hand <strong>sshadd</strong>, you will likely end up with only one instance.</p>
<p><em><strong>Zip up both the private and public key and upload it to Google Drive</strong></em>. That way you can download it at home, and use the private key at both home and school. You don&#39;t have to do it that way, but it allows you to skip the step of creating a new key at home, and uploading that public key to BitBucket. Either system works, and there are arguments in favor of each system, but I want to at least suggest that you do things this way.</p>
<p>Suppose you created <strong>main-key</strong> with a command like this:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-built_in">ln</span> -s MyKey main-<span class="hljs-built_in">key</span>
</code></pre><p>When you type <strong>ls -la</strong> you see <strong>main-key</strong> in red, which means it is not value. After some thought, you realize that you made a mistake creating the key. Perhaps the name of your key was <strong>Prog270Key</strong> and not <strong>MyKey</strong>. Before trying again to create a new version of main-key, first delete it:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-attribute">rm main-key</span>
</code></pre><p>Now try again:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-built_in">ln</span> -s Prog270Key main-<span class="hljs-built_in">key</span>
</code></pre><a class="anchor" id="build-repository"></a>
<h2>Build Repository</h2>
<p>If you created a repository on GitHub with an pre-initialized <strong>README.md</strong> file, then just clone your repository as <a href="#clone-repo">described above</a>. For instance:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">git <span class="hljs-keyword">clone</span> <span class="hljs-title">git</span>@github.com:USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
</code></pre>
<p>This is the simplest way to get started, and is the technique you should probably use. There are times, however, when it is useful to understand how to first create a local repository, and then push it into an empty repository on a cloud site such as GitHub or BitBucket. Though it is simpler to have a pre-initialized <strong>README.md</strong> and then clone a repository, there is much to be learned from followning the steps outlined below. Every single fact you learn about Git makes you a bit more employable. Git is central to web development in many shops and a deep knowledge of its working can help make you very employable.</p>
<p>Once again, this scenario shows how to start a repository on your hard drive, then push it to an empty repository on the cloud. This lesson also demonstrates how to push an existing repository to the cloud.</p>
<p>To get started enter the following, where <strong>lastname</strong> should be your last name, in all lower case letters. Be sure to use dashes instead of underscores, and don&#39;t use any upper case letters:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-built_in">cd</span> ~/Git
<span class="hljs-built_in">mkdir</span> isit320-lastname-<span class="hljs-number">2017</span>
<span class="hljs-built_in">cd</span> isit320-lastname-<span class="hljs-number">2017</span>
git init
</code></pre><p>For instance, here we create a directory and navigate into it:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-built_in">mkdir</span> isit320-calvert-<span class="hljs-number">2017</span>
<span class="hljs-built_in">cd</span> isit320-calvert-<span class="hljs-number">2017</span>
</code></pre><p>Now issue this command where the details will differ in your case:</p>
<pre><code>git remote <span class="hljs-built_in">add</span> origin git@bitbucket.<span class="hljs-built_in">or</span><span class="hljs-variable">g:username</span>/isit320-lastname-<span class="hljs-number">2017</span>.git
</code></pre><p>You can find the exact string, or something very close to it, in GitHub or BitBucket. For instance, when you first create a repository in BitBucket, this string is displayed in the confirmation page for the creation of your repository. For existing repositories, you can find something very like that string by choosing <strong>Actions</strong> (...) and <strong>Clone</strong> from the navigation menu on the left.</p>
<p>Now create a README file in <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=markdown+syntax">markdown</a> format:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-built_in">echo</span> lastname &gt;&gt; README.<span class="hljs-built_in">md</span>
</code></pre><a class="anchor" id="gitignore"></a>
<h2>Create gitignore File</h2>
<p>Before pushing your repository to the cloud, you should create a <strong>.gitignore</strong> file. This file tells Git which files to ignore, which files should not be pushed to the cloud. This may seem like an unimportant step, but for a developer to try to use Git without setting up <strong>.gitignore</strong> file would be a bit like trying to drive a car that had no break. The inevitable result: a 95% chance of rain accompanied by high winds and thunderstorms.</p>
<p>In the root of your repository, create a <strong>.gitignore</strong> file with the following items in it:</p>
<pre><code>node_modules
bower_components
<span class="hljs-selector-class">.metadata</span>
<span class="hljs-selector-class">.idea</span>
<span class="hljs-selector-class">.c9</span>
platforms
Thumbs<span class="hljs-selector-class">.db</span>
*<span class="hljs-selector-class">.zip</span>
npm-debug.log
</code></pre><p>You can create the file with the <a href="http://www.tuxradar.com/content/text-editing-nano-made-easy">nano</a> editor, or do it like this:</p>
<pre><code>echo node_modules &gt;&gt; <span class="hljs-selector-class">.gitignore</span>
echo bower_components &gt;&gt; <span class="hljs-selector-class">.gitignore</span>
echo <span class="hljs-selector-class">.metadata</span> &gt;&gt; <span class="hljs-selector-class">.gitignore</span>
echo <span class="hljs-selector-class">.idea</span> &gt;&gt; <span class="hljs-selector-class">.gitignore</span>
echo <span class="hljs-selector-class">.c9</span> &gt;&gt; <span class="hljs-selector-class">.gitignore</span>
echo Thumbs<span class="hljs-selector-class">.db</span> &gt;&gt; <span class="hljs-selector-class">.gitignore</span>
echo *<span class="hljs-selector-class">.zip</span> &gt;&gt; <span class="hljs-selector-class">.gitignore</span>
echo npm-debug<span class="hljs-selector-class">.log</span> &gt;&gt; .gitignore
</code></pre><p>Files that begin with a period are hidden. To see them, type <strong>ls -la</strong> or <strong>ls -a</strong> or <strong>ll</strong></p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <em>You can learn more about nano by searching for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=nano+editor+cheat+sheet">cheat sheets</a>.</em></p>
<a class="anchor" id="commit"></a>
<h2>Commit your Work</h2>
<p>Now add, commit and push your content:</p>
<pre><code>git <span class="hljs-keyword">add</span><span class="bash"> .
</span>git status
git commit -m <span class="hljs-string">"Initial commit"</span>
git push -u origin master
</code></pre><p>When we type Git add followed by a period we are asking Git to add all the changes we have made to the repository. If you want to add just one file, issue a command like this:</p>
<pre><code>git <span class="hljs-keyword">add</span><span class="bash"> README.md</span>
</code></pre><p>In all cases, after doing an add, you should check your work to make sure all is going well. If, for instance, you see that you have accidentally added in a <strong>node_modules</strong> directory, then you should <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/348234">cancel the add</a>, adjust your <strong>.gitignore</strong> file, and try again.</p>
<p>You only need to use <strong>git push -u origin master</strong> the first time you commit to your repository. After that, you can simply type <strong>git push</strong>.</p>
<p>When upi type <strong>git push -u origin master</strong> then:</p>
<ul>

<p>If you have problems, check these items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is your shh key loaded properly?</li>
<li>Does the URL in your <strong>.git/config</strong> match the URL you see in GitHub. It should begin with Git, not https.

<a class="anchor" id="turn-it-in"></a>
<h2>Turn it in</h2>
<p>Paste in the the URLs for your repository when you submit your assignment. There are two URLs that can be interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li>The URL for your BitBucket or GitHub repository</li>
<li>The URL used to clone your repository</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bitbucket.org/ccalvert/prog219-calvert">https://bitbucket.org/ccalvert/prog219-calvert</a></li>
<li>git@bitbucket.org:lastname/prog272_lastname.git</li>
</ul>
<p>Or</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/charliecalvert/JsObjects">https://github.com/charliecalvert/JsObjects</a></li>
<li>git@github.com:charliecalvert/JsObjects.git</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the time, when I ask for your Git your URL, I want the one I can I use to clone it. It should be clear, however, that either URL will allow me to access your repository.</p>
<p>Whenever you need to send me information when submitting an assignment, you can either enter a comment or use the Text page. When possible, use the Text page, because you can insert live hyperlinks and relatively well formatted text using that option. However, either technique will work.</p>

<h2>Hints</h2>
<p>Various Hints</p>
<a class="anchor" id="merge"></a>
<h3>Avoid Merge Conflicts</h3>
<p>Most of us have a copy of our repository:</p>
<ul>
<li>At home</li>
<li>At school</li>
<li>In the cloud (BitBucket, GitHub)</li>
</ul>
<p>Nearly every day we:</p>
<ul>
<li>We push our repository to the cloud</li>
<li>We pull our repository from the cloud:</li>
</ul>
<p>We do that with these commands:</p>
<p>To push we typically:</p>
<pre><code>git <span class="hljs-keyword">add</span><span class="bash"> .
</span>git commit -m <span class="hljs-string">"Some message"</span>
git push
</code></pre><p>Pull:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-attribute">git pull</span>
</code></pre><p>If you pull without pushing first, eventually you will hit merge conflicts. You will have one version of your code at home, another version in the cloud, and yet another version at school. This is bad. To avoid Merge conflicts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&#39;t forget to push before you go home</li>
<li>And to pull as soon as you start work at home</li>
<li>If you do get a merge conflict, then read this</li>
</ul>
<a class="anchor" id="id-git"></a>
<h3>Identify a repository</h3>
<p>You can identify a repository by looking for the hidden directory named <strong>.git</strong>. If that file
exists, then you are in the root of a Git repository.</p>
<p>In this listing, you can tell that the file called <strong>README.md</strong> is in a Git repository
because a long (l) listing (ls) of the directory with the hidden flag (a) reveals the existence of
the <strong>.git</strong> folder:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">$ ls -la
total 16
drwxrwxr-x <span class="hljs-number"> 3 </span>charlie charlie<span class="hljs-number"> 4096 </span>Sep<span class="hljs-number"> 24 </span>10:55 .
drwxrwxr-x<span class="hljs-number"> 14 </span>charlie charlie<span class="hljs-number"> 4096 </span>Sep<span class="hljs-number"> 24 </span>10:55 ..
drwxrwxr-x <span class="hljs-number"> 7 </span>charlie charlie<span class="hljs-number"> 4096 </span>Sep<span class="hljs-number"> 24 </span>10:55 .git
-rw-rw-r-- <span class="hljs-number"> 1 </span>charlie charlie   <span class="hljs-number"> 4 </span>Sep<span class="hljs-number"> 24 </span>10:55 README.md
</code></pre>
<a class="anchor" id="git-nest"></a>
<h3>Don&#39;t Nest Repositories</h3>
<p>Don&#39;t create one repository inside another unless you are sure you know what
you are doing. It is possible to nest repos, but it is special case and requires
specific knowledge on how to proceed.</p>
<p>In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&#39;t <strong>pull</strong> the Elvenware JsObjects repository into your repository.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t create your repository inside the JsObjects repository</li>
<li>Don&#39;t create your repository inside any other repository.</li>
</ul>

<a class="anchor" id="bitbucket-code"></a>
<h3>BitBucket Sample Code</h3>
<p>Sample code from the BitBucket when you first create a repository. I&#39;m
including this just because it.</p>
<p>Set up local directory:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-built_in">mkdir</span> /path/<span class="hljs-keyword">to</span>/your/project
<span class="hljs-keyword">cd</span> /path/<span class="hljs-keyword">to</span>/your/project
git init
git remote <span class="hljs-built_in">add</span> origin git@bitbucket.<span class="hljs-built_in">or</span><span class="hljs-variable">g:ccalvert</span>/isit320-deleteme-<span class="hljs-number">2015</span>.git
</code></pre><p>Create your first file, commit, and push</p>
<pre><code>echo <span class="hljs-string">"Charlie Calvert"</span> &gt;&gt; contributors<span class="hljs-selector-class">.txt</span>
git add contributors<span class="hljs-selector-class">.txt</span>
git commit -m <span class="hljs-string">'Initial commit with contributors'</span>
git push -u origin master
</code></pre><a class="anchor" id="github-code"></a>
<h3>GitHub Sample Code</h3>
<p>Here is the sample code suggested by GitHub.</p>
<p>Create a new repository in an existing directory from the command line:</p>
<pre><code>echo <span class="hljs-string">"# deleteme06"</span> &gt;&gt; README<span class="hljs-selector-class">.md</span>
git init
git add README<span class="hljs-selector-class">.md</span>
git commit -m <span class="hljs-string">"first commit"</span>
git remote add origin git@github<span class="hljs-selector-class">.com</span>:charliecalvert/deleteme06<span class="hljs-selector-class">.git</span>
git push -u origin master
</code></pre><p>Push an existing repository for the first time to a new repository:</p>
<pre><code>git remote add origin git@github<span class="hljs-selector-class">.com</span>:charliecalvert/deleteme06<span class="hljs-selector-class">.git</span>
git push -u origin master
</code></pre><a class="anchor" id="fingerprints"></a>
<h3>RSA Fingerprints</h3>
<p>It is possible to spoof a URL or even an IP address. As a result, when you
push and pull from BitBucket or GitHub, Git checks to see that the machine
you are connecting to is the correct machine. In particular, it looks in
this file for the fingerprint of your remote machine:</p>
<pre><code>~<span class="hljs-regexp">/.ssh/</span>known-hosts
</code></pre><p>If the machine you are going to connect to is not listed in known-hosts, then
the connection will be aborted.</p>
<p>When you first push to BitBucket or any new SSH server, you should be prompted
to confirm the authenticity of the site:</p>
<pre><code>git push -u origin <span class="hljs-comment">--all</span>
The authenticity <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> host <span class="hljs-symbol">'bitbucket</span>.org (<span class="hljs-number">131.103</span>.<span class="hljs-number">20.168</span>)' can<span class="hljs-symbol">'t</span> be established.
RSA key fingerprint <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> <span class="hljs-number">97</span>:<span class="hljs-number">8</span>c:<span class="hljs-number">1</span>b:f2:<span class="hljs-number">6</span>f:<span class="hljs-number">14</span>:<span class="hljs-number">6</span>b:<span class="hljs-number">5</span>c:<span class="hljs-number">3</span>b:ec:aa:<span class="hljs-number">46</span>:<span class="hljs-number">46</span>:<span class="hljs-number">74</span>:<span class="hljs-number">7</span>c:<span class="hljs-number">40</span>.
Are you sure you want <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
<span class="hljs-literal">Warning</span>: Permanently added <span class="hljs-symbol">'bitbucket</span>.org' (RSA) <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> the list <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> known hosts.
</code></pre><p>When you type in <strong>yes</strong> at the prompt, the fingerprint for this server is
stored in your <strong>known_hosts</strong> file. You can read more about this process on
Elvenware.</p>

<a class="anchor" id="error-checks"></a>
<h2>Error Checks</h2>
<p>If you get the error &quot;Not a git repository&quot;, then it is likely that one of two things has happened:</p>
<ol>
<li>You are not in your repository, and need to use <strong>cd</strong> to navigate into it.</li>
<li>You are in your repository, but have not yet run <strong>git init</strong>. But remember, once you have created your repository for this course, this is no need to run <strong>git init</strong> a second time. Instead, just clone the repository.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you try to clone your repository, and you get a public key error then it is likely that one of the two things has happened:</p>
<ol>
<li>You have forgotten to load your private key with <strong>ssh-add</strong> or <strong>sshadd</strong>.</li>
<li>Or you have loaded a private key, but failed to place its matching public key in BitBuctket/GitHub.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember that when you create a repository for the first time, you need to share it with me. To share your repository, you need to know my user name. On</p>
<ul>
<li>BitBucket it is ccalvert</li>
<li>GitHub it is charliecalvert</li>
</ul>
<p>Though it may confuse matters somewhat, I should perhaps add that it is not wrong to pull down an existing repository onto your machine for the first time by first typing <strong>git init</strong>. It is just that I think it is simpler to pull it down by cloning it. Also, we have to be sure never to type <strong>git init</strong> outside our repository, and particular, by typing it in our home directory or in the <strong>~/Git</strong> directory.</p>
<a class="anchor" id="git-clone-and-git-init"></a>
<h2>Git Clone and Git Init</h2>
<p>You can use <strong>git clone</strong> only on existing repositories. You can&#39;t use <strong>git clone</strong> if the repository does not already exist somewhere. Even if the repository is completely empty, you can still use <strong>git clone</strong>. There is, of course, a difference between an non-existent repository and an empty repository.</p>
<p>You can use <strong>git init</strong> to help you fetch an existing repository, or to create an entirely new repository that does not exist yet.</p>
<p>Once again, you can clone an empty repository, you just can&#39;t clone a non-existent repository.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>git clone</strong> sets up your local repository to use the remote cloud server for your repository. It also tells your local repository which branch to use.</li>
<li><strong>git init</strong> creates a repository, but does not automatically set up the remote server nor specify the branch.</li>
</ul>
<p>To put the matter somewhat differently: <strong>git clone</strong> makes a copy of an existing repository, but gives you little control of the process. In most cases, you don&#39;t need that control, so use <strong>git clone</strong>. However, if you want more control, or more in depth understanding of how Git works, then use <strong>git init</strong>.</p>
<p>The following are two ways of doing the same thing. We could use either one when pulling down an existing repository with some content in it.</p>
<p>Use <strong>git init</strong> plus <strong>git remote</strong> plus <strong>git pull</strong>:</p>
<pre>mkdir DeleteMe05
cd DeleteMe05
git init
git remote add origin git@bitbucket.org:ccalvert/DeleteMe05.git
git pull origin master</pre>

<p>Or use clone:</p>
<pre>git clone git@bitbucket.org:ccalvert/DeleteMe05.git</pre>

<p>If we have an existing repository in the cloud, one that contains content, even if the only content is a README, then we usually don&#39;t want to use <strong>git init</strong>. Instead, we just use <strong>git clone</strong> and pull down the whole repository. We do this, in our case, from the <strong>~/Git</strong> directory. In other words, we almost never do it from inside an existing repository, or from inside a folder that we want to make the root of a new repository. You can use either technique to pull down an existing repository, but <strong>git clone</strong> is less likely to lead to errors because it has fewer steps and less typing.</p>
<p>Here are the instructions that BitBucket gives us for creating a new repository:</p>
<pre>mkdir /path/to/your/project
cd /path/to/your/project
git init
git remote add origin git@bitbucket.org:ccalvert/deleteme06.git

echo "Charlie Calvert" >> contributors.txt
git add contributors.txt
git commit -m 'Initial commit with contributors'
git push -u origin master</pre>

<p>Note that these instructions say <strong>git push</strong> while the first example I give above says <strong>git pull</strong>. Take a moment to look and see the difference. It&#39;s not obvious.</p>
<p>The <strong>git push</strong> shown in the BitBucket instructions only makes sense because we created an empty repository in BitBucket and we want to push new content that we created locally into it. If we have an existing repository with content, then use <strong>git pull</strong>.</p>
<p>One thing in favor of the code shown in my first example and in the BitBucket example is that it shows exactly what is happening, while Git clone does a lot of work behind the scenes. Still, <strong>git clone</strong> is a lot simpler to use... Perhaps BitBucket and GitHub use the somewhat more complex code simply to raise the bar a bit, and keep out complete neophytes?</p>
<a class="anchor" id="set-git-url"></a>
<h2>Set Git URL</h2>
<p>The following information is for advanced users only. You do not need this if you are just getting started.</p>
<p>In your hidden <strong>.git</strong> folder, in a file called <strong>config</strong>, Git stores the URL for your repository. If you want to find that URL without opening up the <strong>config</strong> file, issue this command from inside your repository:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-attribute">git remote -v</span>
</code></pre><p>This should work for any repository on your system. For instance, try the above command in <strong>JsObjects</strong>.</p>
<p>If you want to change or set the URL you are using on your local machine, try something like this:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-string">git </span><span class="hljs-string">remote </span><span class="hljs-built_in">set-url</span> <span class="hljs-string">origin </span><span class="hljs-string">git@</span><span class="hljs-string">github.</span><span class="hljs-string">com:my-</span><span class="hljs-string">user-name/</span><span class="hljs-string">my-repo.</span><span class="hljs-string">git</span>
</code></pre><p>If you are uncertain about the URL for your repository, you should able to easily find it on either GitHub or BitBucket.</p>
<a class="anchor" id="ruminations"></a>
<h2>Ruminations</h2>
<p>Both at home, and at school, you want to have a ~/.ssh directory. In that directory, you should have a private key and a public key. The private key is only on your machines. Never give it to anyone else. The public key you insert into the proper dialog on GitHub (or BitBucket) or some other site as needed.</p>
<p>You have two choices:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use the same private key on home and school machine. Put the private key in a zip file, upload it to Google Drive, and download it from there on you second machine. That way you have the same private key on both your home and school machines. That means you need to put only one public key on GitHub.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Alternatively: Create two private/public key pairs, one at home and one at school. Then put both public keys on GitHub and or BitBucket.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The code for creating a private/public key pair can be seen here, and elsewhere in my notes:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/development/cloud/SshFtpsPutty.html#sshKeys">http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/development/cloud/SshFtpsPutty.html#sshKeys</a></p>
<p>Be sure to look at this deck:</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/git-basics">http://bit.ly/git-basics</a></p>
<p>And this document/assignment: <a href="http://www.ccalvert.net/books/CloudNotes/Assignments/GitNewRepo.html">http://www.ccalvert.net/books/CloudNotes/Assignments/GitNewRepo.html</a></p>
<p>It would definitely be a mistake to put a private key in a public Git repository. A private repository is probably okay to use, but still not recommended as eventually you may want to share your repository with others. Putting your public keys on Git is probably okay, but also probably not very useful. The best plan is to either create two or more pairs, or to create one pair and upload to Google Drive so you can download it as needed at home or at school.</p>
<p>If you want, it is possible to put a password on your private key.</p>
