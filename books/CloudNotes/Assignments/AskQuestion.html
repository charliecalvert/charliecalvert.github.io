<h1 id="ask-a-question">Ask a Question</h1>
<p>Ask a technical question in the discussion area related to this week's assignments, or to a technology that we have been using regularly.</p>
<h2 id="appropriate-questions">Appropriate Questions</h2>
<p>It would be appropriate to ask about:</p>
<ul>
<li>An assignment due this week. For instance, the Patterns Assignment</li>
<li>JavaScript syntax covered in class such as Object Literals or the Modular Pattern. It's okay to ask about any syntax that we have covered in class. Syntax questions don't have to have been covered this week. You can ask about something we talked about two weeks ago, or three weeks ago, or whenever.</li>
<li>A library we are using such as Jasmine, requirejs, Jade or Express etc.</li>
<li>A technical tool we use regularly such as Node, npm, Karma, JsHint, or Grunt.</li>
<li>Git, BitBucket and SSH.</li>
<li>Linux and the Linux command line</li>
<li>VirtualBox, Eclipse, Geany or any other tool we use regularly.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are also reasonable questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I'm working on the Queue's assignemnt and can't figure out how to get started. Is there a JsObjects example program somewhere I can use to help me bootstrap my assignment?</em></li>
<li><em>How do I upgrade to the most recent version of Express?</em></li>
<li><em>How do I format my code in Eclipse</em></li>
<li><em>How to I run JsHint on my <strong>PurpleMage.js</strong> file.</em></li>
<li><em>What the heck is the difference between an HTML class and an ID</em>?</li>
</ul>
<p>Just be careful that you are not asking a question that has already been asked.</p>
<h2 id="inappropriate-questions">Inappropriate Questions</h2>
<p>Subjects that would not be appropriate:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to create a class in C#? (Wrong subject)</li>
<li>What is better, C# or Python? Why are we using JavaScript instead of X? (Too general. Not technical. Just a matter of opinion.)</li>
<li>How do I use Git to host a gamer development project? (We are using Git, but this is not a part of Git we are covering.)</li>
<li>Who will win the 2016 Presidential election? (Not related to our class at all. Likely to foment controversy)</li>
<li>My Dad gets a dreamy look in his eyes when my girlfriend comes over and I signed up for 5 graduate level courses in addition to this class. I feel like I'm drowning and this Internet stuff is just a flash in the pan anyway, so do you think I should move out of my parent's house and live on my own? I find myself watching The Terminator over and over and sweating a lot because I can't understand this assignment. Do you think its okay if I skip class week? (Too emotional and too personal.)</li>
<li>Where on Elvenware are callbacks covered? This is a good question, but it needs to be rephrased: How do I find the place on Elvenware where JavaScript callbacks are covered? Answer: search on Google for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=JavaScript%20callbacks%20site:elvenware.com">JavaScript callbacks site:elvenware.com</a>.</li>
<li>Why are we using Jasmine instead of QUnit? This is a reasonable question and okay to ask, but it is not technical or specific enough to satisfy the requirements of this assignment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="question-guidelines">Question Guidelines</h2>
<p>Your question must be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unique. This means that you should refresh (F5) the discussion area before you ask the question, and make sure no one else has already asked the question. If two people ask the same question, whoever asks first gets credit, and the person who asked second must ask another question.</li>
<li>Related to our class, and preferrably to an assignment we are working on this week.</li>
<li>Technical. Don't ask open ended questions that can't be answered concisely. Your questions should be about JavaScript, node, the libraries we use, or the tools we use.</li>
<li>Reasonable. For instance, if I asked you to create a table with the time of the sunrise in Bellevue WA over the next week, you can't ask: &quot;What is the sun? I don't understand.&quot; That is not a reasonable question. Everyone knows about the sun, and it is not plausible that you don't understand that part of the assignment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dont-provide-an-answer">Don't Provide an Answer</h2>
<p>In general don't quote code in your questions. The worst possible question would be:</p>
<p><em>Here is the code for me answer to question 3. Is it correct?</em></p>
<pre><code>var a = 3 * square(5);</code></pre>
<p>A close second might be:</p>
<p><em>What is the answer to question three?</em></p>
<p>Try to ask questions that can benefit yourself and others, and that don't become a platform for stating the answer to a question.</p>
<h2 id="question-format">Question Format</h2>
<p>Typically your question will have three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The question itself.</li>
<li>The error messages you are getting</li>
<li>What you did to get the error. Steps to reproduce.</li>
<li>The platform you are using</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a classic example:</p>
<p><em>QUESTION: I'm trying to create my unit tests for a project. I've created an HTML file that loads requirejs. It sets data-main to <strong>MainTest.js</strong>. When I launch the HTML file in the browser the screen is completely blank. I have no idea what is wrong or how to go about fixing the problem. How do I get started.</em></p>
<p><em>ERROR: I'm not getting any error messages that I can see. I'm just completely stuck.</em></p>
<p><em>STEPS: Create an HTML that uses require js. Set <strong>MainTest.js</strong> as <strong>data-main</strong>. I'm basing my work on the <strong>SimpleQueue</strong> program from JsObjects.</em></p>
<p><em>PLATFORM: I'm using Eclipse and working in Lubuntu 13.10 running in VirtualBox. My network was down while I was working. My browser was FireFox</em></p>
<p>The answer to the above question, of course, is that one should run the program in Chrome and press F12 to view any error messages that might be present. (One could also get the errors by pressing F12 in FireFox. Both browsers have good developer tools.)</p>
<p>So let's ask the same question again, but this time include an error message from the Chrome debugger. Everything from above is the same, but this time here is the error section of the question:</p>
<p><em>ERROR: I loaded the program in Chrome, pressed F12, and saw this in the console window:</em></p>
<pre><code>GET file:///C:/Src/BridgeReader/apublic/javascripts/Readers/MarkdownReader.js net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND 
Uncaught Error: Script error for: MarkdownReader
http://requirejs.org/docs/errors.html#scripterror </code></pre>
<p>It is more difficult to ask questions about the syntax of the JavaScript language. The danger is that you might give away the answer to a question by describing your error. Suppose you had an assignment to print the word <strong>Garply</strong> to the console. To fulfill the assignment, you came up with a file called <strong>Chub.js</strong> with the following contents:</p>
<pre><code>// Assignment 01
// by Vari Quigley

function qux {
    console.log(&quot;Garply!&quot;);
}</code></pre>
<p>You got an error when you tried to run the program by typing:</p>
<pre><code>node Chub.js</code></pre>
<p>You struggled and struggled trying to find out what was wrong, but couldn't solve the problem. Here is how to ask the question:</p>
<p><em>I have question about an error message I get when I try to run my program with node.</em></p>
<p><em>Here is the error message I get:</em></p>
<pre><code>&gt;node Temp.js

C:\Temp\Temp.js:4
function qux {
             ^
SyntaxError: Unexpected token {
    at Module._compile (module.js:439:25)
    at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:474:10)
    at Module.load (module.js:356:32)
    at Function.Module._load (module.js:312:12)
    at Function.Module.runMain (module.js:497:10)
    at startup (node.js:119:16)
    at node.js:902:3</code></pre>
<p><em>Here is the command I give to create the error:</em></p>
<pre><code>node Chub.js</code></pre>
<p><em>I'm running on Linux and using <strong>node</strong> version <strong>0.10.26</strong>.</em></p>
<p>The above is fine because you do not quote significant portions of your program. There is one line from your program seen in the error message, but it is not an important line. It is just a plain old function header.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when asking questions, you must be careful not to give the answer to question. In general, this means don't publish source code. For instance, suppose you are asked to add two variables. For instance, suppose this was the assignment: <em>Given the following declarations, how would you calculate the sum of a and b</em>:</p>
<pre><code>var a = 3;
var b = 12;</code></pre>
<p>That is the whole question. Suppose you tried to solve the problem by writing this:</p>
<pre><code>// Assignment 01
// by Vari Quigley

function qux() {
    var a = 3;
    var b = 12;
    var result = a + d;
}

console.log(qux());</code></pre>
<p>When you ran the program, you got this error:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;node Temp.js

C:\Temp\Temp.js:7
    var result = a + d;
                     ^
ReferenceError: d is not defined
    at qux (C:\Temp\Temp.js:7:22)
    at Object.&lt;anonymous&gt; (C:\Temp\Temp.js:10:13)
    at Module._compile (module.js:456:26)
    at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:474:10)
    at Module.load (module.js:356:32)
    at Function.Module._load (module.js:312:12)
    at Function.Module.runMain (module.js:497:10)
    at startup (node.js:119:16)
    at node.js:902:3</code></pre>
<p>To quote the line <strong>var result = a + d;</strong> is to give away your attempted solution to the problem. In a case like this, just show the error message. For instance:</p>
<p><em>I'm trying to use a variable in my program, but I keep getting the following error. What does it mean</em>:</p>
<pre><code>ReferenceError: d is not defined
    at qux (C:\Temp\Temp.js:7:22)
    at Object.&lt;anonymous&gt; (C:\Temp\Temp.js:10:13)
    at Module._compile (module.js:456:26)
    at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:474:10)
    at Module.load (module.js:356:32)
    at Function.Module._load (module.js:312:12)
    at Function.Module.runMain (module.js:497:10)
    at startup (node.js:119:16)
    at node.js:902:3
    
    </code></pre>
<h2 id="general-tips">General Tips</h2>
<p>Use the classic <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask">advice from StackOverflow</a> on how to ask good questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Search carefully to see if the question has already been asked. Once you are done searching, search again.</li>
<li>Be on topic. Don't ask a C#, SQL or political question in our discussion area.</li>
<li>Be specific
<ul>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/dont-ask">Don't ask overly general questions</a> that are just matters of opinion.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Make it relevant to others</li>
<li>Keep an open mind</li>
</ul>
<p>We don't have a meta site, so questions about the course or the direction we are taking in the course can be asked in the discussion area, but they probably will not count as the solution for this assignment.</p>
<p>If English is not your native language, work doubly hard to keep your question short and specific:</p>
<p>Question: I can't run my program because of error. Error: I get this error ... Reproduce: I typed this: npm start Platform: Linux, Geany, node v0.10.26.</p>
<h2 id="answering-questions">Answering Questions</h2>
<p>No one has to answer questions, but of course it is great if you can answer someone else's question. It is not exactly that you get <em>extra credit</em> for doing so, but I notice that someone is answering questions and that can help when it comes time to calculate the <strong>class participation</strong> part of your score for this course.</p>
<p>When answering questions you must continue to avoid quoting code directly. Don't give away answers.</p>
<p>Typical answers might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a look at the FactorySimple01 example from JsObjects. Look in <strong>main.js</strong>, you will see an example of how to solve the problem in there.</li>
<li>That is covered on Elvenware here: <strong>Provide a link</strong>.</li>
<li>That is discussed here on StackOverflow: <strong>Provide a link</strong>.</li>
<li>The answer to that question is easily found on the Internet. Enter a serach like this on Google: <strong>Provide a search string.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Don't point to third party resources that provide full anwers. For instance, if I asked you to calculate a factorial, you should not provide a list of places on the Internet where others have solved that problem using JavaScript. You can, however, mention that using Google might be a good idea in a case like this.</p>
<p>Try to provide answers or use syntax that we use in class. For instance, we are using <strong>express</strong> a lot in this class. It would not be appropriate to answer: <em>I suggest dumping Express and using the great <strong>RetroQuirks</strong> library instead.</em> And don't say something like this: You are using the <strong>modular</strong> pattern, but I think it would be better if you just created one method called <strong>main</strong> and put all your code in there. Try to follow the coding conventions we use in class.</p>
