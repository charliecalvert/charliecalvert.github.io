<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Create a fresh version of your Cloud 9 workspace. This may be necessary to ensure that mongo will run correctly on it. I was having trouble starting MongoDb in my original Cloud Nine workspace, perhaps because it was so full, perhaps because of some other reason. This exercise should ensure three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>That you are using the last possible amount of space on Cloud 9. For instance, I went from about 95% used to about 25% when performing this exercise.</li>
<li>To ensure that the your Cloud 9 workspace is clean. The great advantage of virtual environments is that we can &quot;start fresh&quot;, cleaning up any mistakes that may have crept into a previous workspace instance.</li>
<li>Show you that you can create a new instance quickly and easily. After practicing it a few times, I found I could run through this exercise in well under 5 minutes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <em>Simple creating a new Node JS based workspace in Cloud Nine is enough to provide you with a workspace in which you can create node applications. I provide extra steps in this exercise because I like my environment configured in a particular manner. In particular, I want to ensure:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>JsObjects</strong> has been cloned and is available to us</li>
<li>We have set up customized <strong>.bashrc</strong> and <strong>.bash_aliases</strong> files.<ul>
<li>This includes setting up our path and other environment variables</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We have a pre-configured <strong>bin</strong> directory with useful scripts in it.</li>
<li>Have certain Npm global packages installed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>Read the cloud nine setup steps from here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ccalvert.net/books/CloudNotes/Assignments/Cloud9Intro.html#auto-setup">Cloud Nine Setup Description (AutoSetup)</a></li>

<h2>Turn it in</h2>
<p>Attach two screen shots to your assignment. To create Screen Shot I:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click the gear (settings) in the workspace window on the left of Cloud Nine. Make sure &quot;Show home in favorites&quot; is selected.</li>
<li>Expand the <strong>~/bin</strong> directory</li>
<li>Open the README.md from Solar Explorer. If it is not there already, type your name near the top of this file.</li>
<li>Take a screen shot</li>
<li>Attach your screen shot to the assignment. Do not embed it in a Word document, do not put it in a zip file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Screen Shot Two</p>
<ul>
<li>Click the gear (settings) in the workspace window on the left of Cloud Nine. Make sure &quot;Show home in favorites&quot; is NOT selected.</li>
<li>Expand the <strong>~/workspace</strong> directory, which is probably labeled <strong>prog219-lastname-2016</strong>. This is the folder that contains your projects, that contains the contents of your repository.</li>
<li>In the terminal, checkout your latest branch, such as week09. We should see a list of the projects you have created this quarter, from Week01 through Week09.</li>
<li>Take a screen shot</li>
<li>Attach your screen shot to the assignment. Do not embed it in a Word document, do not put it in a zip file.</li>
</ul>
