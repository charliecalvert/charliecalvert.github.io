<h2>Sheets</h2>
<p>Put data about the documents you are going to share in Google Sheets and OneDrive Spreadsheets. Place these documents in your shared folder (the one from the Online Presence assignment.) Place it in a directory called <strong>Final</strong>. </p>
<p>In your documennt there should be at least seven rows of data. You need to fill in three columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>A platform/tool such as Google Drive, OneDrive, Evernote, EC2, S3 and Google Site.</li>
<li>A folder name</li>
<li>An email address</li>
</ul>
<p>In the second column, you should include folder names that you shared with me during the Online Presence assignment.</p>
<ul>
<li>The folder on Google Drive and the email address you shared it with.</li>
<li>The folder on OneDrive and the email address you shared it with.</li>
<li>The folder on Evernote and the email address you shared it with</li>
</ul>

<p>When filling the email values there are a few of you who need to think long and hard before filling them in. Though we have had repeated exercises and reminders that you are not yet sharing your folders with the correct email address, still problems persist. This is the final. You don&#39;t want to get it wrong. For help in understanding the email to choose, review the online presence assignment. Here are links to the Online Presence document and links to the places where I specify the email address for each shared folder or document:</p>

<p>Here is the FinalData Sheet on Google Drive:</p>
<p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=0B25UTAlOfPRGa3huQ25WVVkxeE0" alt="Sheet"></p>
<p>Here is the FinalData Document in Google Drive:</p>
<p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=0B25UTAlOfPRGVU9vX0o2VmxIWVk" alt="Document"></p>
<p>You will need to create similar documents on OneDrive, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=0B25UTAlOfPRGRXBKNjJFM2djdkE" alt="OneDrive"></p>
<p>Getting the data from your Microsoft Spread Sheet into a Microsoft Word document may prove to be a bit of challenge. Perhaps I was missing something, but ultimately I had to copy, and/or format, the data one field at a time. In the end, however, it looks create in Word Online:</p>
<p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=0B25UTAlOfPRGQkF0MEVEZDRic0E" alt="WordOneDrive"></p>
<a class="anchor" id="devices"></a>
<h2>Devices</h2>
<p>On your mobile device, provide a screenshots of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OneDrive/Excel</strong>: Show your FinalData spreadsheet in Microsoft Office</li>
<li><strong>OneDrive/Word</strong>: Show your docment in Microsoft Office for Mobile</li>
<li><strong>Google Sheets</strong>: Show your spreadsheet </li>
<li><strong>Google Docs</strong>: Show your document</li>
<li><strong>Evernote:</strong> Show your document or sheet or web page pasted into a note</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is what the Microsoft Office for Android version of the SpreadSheet looks like:</p>
<p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=0B25UTAlOfPRGYmxfTXNjQm5fNFk" alt="OneDrive"></p>
<p>Here is the Microsoft Office for Android version of the Word Document looks like:</p>
<p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=0B25UTAlOfPRGVE40XzNoSU5BVlk" alt="OneDrive"></p>
<a class="anchor" id="web-page"></a>
<h2>Web Page</h2>
<p>Take all the images from the previous sections, and do the following with them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a markdown file in StackEdit. </li>
<li>Show the images in your markdown file. </li>
<li>Export to HTML</li>
<li>Push your markdown file, HTML and the images to Git in a folder called <strong>Week12-Final</strong>.  You can use CodeAnywhere, VirtualBox, or <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git for Windows/Mac</a> to get your documents and images into Git.  </li>
<li>Display your completed HTML pages on EC2 and S3.</li>
<li>Block copy the output from the pages your created on EC2 and S3. I don&#39;t you want you to block copy the markdown code or HTML, I want you to copy the rendered HTML as it appears in your browser. It should look pretty. When you have made the copy to the clipboard, paste the output into:<ul>
<li>Evernote</li>
<li>A folder called Week12_Final on OneDrive</li>
<li>A folder called Week12_Final on Google Drive</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are unclear on how to complete the last step, please watch <a href="http://youtu.be/vrmhw4iJvMs">this video</a>. We have done this kind of exercise in previous assignments, but about a fifth of the class was unable to complete this simple exercise. If you have any doubt as to how to proceed, then please watch the video! Its not a question of whether or not you know how to do it, you do, it is just a question of being sure you know what to do!</p>
<a class="anchor" id="organize-your-sites"></a>
<h2>Organize Your Sites</h2>
<p>On all three websites you have placed a number of documents. These sites include:</p>
<ul>
<li>S3</li>
<li>EC2</li>
<li>Google Site</li>
</ul>
<p>On at least one of the sites, and perhaps all three, create a main page that links to all your other pages. Think of this as a resume that will detail to perspective employers what you know about creating web sites, and sharing data on mobile sites.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Look in the menu for your Google Site and make sure you have checked the button for making your site look good on a mobile site.</p>
<a class="anchor" id="big-share"></a>
<h2>Big Share</h2>
<p>I will share one document with everyone in the class:</p>
<p>A Google Sheet will be shared with everyone in the class. There will be about 25 rows in the sheet. Your name will be on one of the rows. You should add your favorite:</p>
<ul>
<li>book</li>
<li>movie</li>
<li>link (Some link to a place on the web that you think is interesting, cool, representative of who you are, etc.)</li>
<li>An optional comment. If you have some cheerful thought you want to share with others...</li>
</ul>
<p>A few folks seem to be leaving pictures up there too. I suppose that is okay so long as we don&#39;t get too carried away....</p>
<p>This part of the assignment is mostly for fun, but please do participate. I will check to be sure you contributed to our group effort. </p>
<p>If you have not yet received an invite then let me know. The invite was sent to the Google email account you gave me in the online presence assignment. If something else went wrong, and you can&#39;t access the sheet even though you tried, then let me know.</p>
<a class="anchor" id="final-document"></a>
<h2>Final Document</h2>
<p>Create a folder in Google Drive called <strong>Final</strong>. Create a document in that folder called <strong>FinalGuide</strong>. In that document describe how the final went for you. Use the document to detail any information you think I might need to know when grading your final. In the document, include links to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your Google Site</li>
<li>EC2 Home page (or multiple pages if necessary)</li>
<li>S3 Home page (or multiple pages if necessary)</li>
</ul>
<p>Include screen shots of your work on EC2, S3, EverNote, etc. In other words, if for some reason some of the links don&#39;t work, let me see this screen shots to confirm that you at least tried to get the data in the right folders.</p>
<p>When I grade your final, I will create document in your <strong>Final</strong> folder called <strong>FromCharlie</strong> where I will outline any comments I might have on your final and your performance this quarter.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <em>Finals week is stressful. Every once in awhile a student will have a brief meltdown during finals week and use the <strong>FinalDocument</strong> or some similar location to say things that they really don&#39;t want to say to their teacher while the teacher is deciding what grade to give them. Constructive comments are always welcome, but try to keep the tone civil.</em></p>
<a class="anchor" id="turn-it-in"></a>
<h2>Turn it in</h2>
<p>Just submit the final by pushing the button. You can provide links in the text area, but everything I need to grade you should be in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Drive</li>
<li>OneDrive</li>
<li>Evernote</li>
<li>Git</li>
<li>EC2</li>
<li>S3</li>
<li>Google Sites</li>
</ul>
