<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In this class we use a variety of cloud services. Most of these services are free, or very reasonably priced. This assignments is designed to ensure that you have a foothold in these various services.</p>
<p>Our focus will be on learning to use the cloud in a safe, secure and public spirited manner.</p>
<p>In particular, we will be asked to create a Google Account if you don&#39;t already have one. Here is a summary of what I want you to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a> and create a google account.  </li>
<li>Set up a gmail account. (<a href="http://www.google.com/mail">http://www.google.com/mail</a>)</li>
<li>Create a Google site (<a href="http://www.google.com/sites">http://www.google.com/sites</a>).</li>
<li>In Google Drive (aka Google Docs) create a Google Folder and share it with me. See above for a description of how to name that folder.</li>
<li>Use the email address shown below when sharing your Google Drive folder. This is not the same address you use when sharing Microsoft folders.</li>
</ul>
<a class="anchor" id="useful-tips"></a>
<h2>Useful Tips</h2>
<p>Back in the day getting people to use online accounts was difficult. There was a huge resistance by students to doing anything in the cloud. As a result, I added a lot of text to this assignment designed to allay fears and help them understand basic habits for online thinking. I don&#39;t think those tips are absolutely necessary any longer, so I have moved them into <a href="http://www.ccalvert.net/books/CloudNotes/Assignments/OnlinePresence.html">their own document</a>. Some students, however, still might want to at least skim over them.</p>
<a class="anchor" id="video"></a>
<h2>Video</h2>
<p>A number of years ago I created a video showing how to share documents on Google Drive. Parts of it are now outdated, but the process is substantially still the same, so I&#39;ll continue to use it:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://youtu.be/NMkTz3Rvgfo">Google Share Document Video</a></li>
</ul>
<a class="anchor" id="my-email"></a>
<h2>My Email</h2>
<p>The email address to use when sharing your Google Drive is shown below. So that black hat snoopers can&#39;t find my email too easily, I have translated it into plain English. It should, however, be a simple task for you to convert it into a normal email address:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>charliecalvertbc at gmail dot com</strong></li>
</ul>
<a class="anchor" id="folder-names"></a>
<h2>Folder names</h2>
<p>This assignment involves creating folders on Google Drive, One Drive and Evernote. The name of your folder should contain three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The class name</li>
<li>Your last name</li>
<li>The year</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are example names for each of my classes, pick the appropriate name for this class:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prog270-LastName-2017</li>
<li>Prog272-LastName-2017</li>
<li>Isit320-LastName-2017</li>
<li>Isit322-LastName-2017</li>
</ul>
<p>Where I write <strong>LastName</strong>, please substitute your last name. For instance, if this class is Prog272, then I would create a folder called <strong>2015-Prog272-Calvert</strong>.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of <strong>improper</strong> folder names:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prog270-LastName -- &gt; <em>Year missing</em></li>
<li>Prog272 --&gt; <em>Year and last name missing</em></li>
<li>Isit320-2017 --&gt; <em>Last name missing</em></li>
<li>PROG270-CALVERT-2017 --&gt; <strong>Capitalization (casing) wrong</strong></li>
<li>PROG270_CALVERT-2015 --&gt; <strong>Underscore rather than dash and case issues</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you get the casing or name wrong then I might not find your folder at all, and it will certainly cause me extra work to sort through long lists looking for your folder. I depend on folders being sorted properly. If you don&#39;t name your folder properly then it most likely will not be sorted properly.</p>
<p>No one but you and me will ever see these folders. It is not a risk to use your name in their creation.</p>
<a class="anchor" id="the-basics"></a>
<h2>The Basics</h2>
<p>In this assignment we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a document on Google Drive.</li>
<li>Place the document in in a folder you have shared with me.</li>
<li>Share both the folder and the document with the email account [described above][#my-email].</li>
<li>Be sure I have rights to edit this document, your folder and everything you submit for this course via Google Drive. In general, if you first share the folder with me, then everything you place in the folder should be shared with me automatically.</li>
</ul>
<p>In your new folder, create a document called <strong>OnlinePresence-LastName</strong>, where <strong>LastName</strong> is your last name. It should contain the same information as found in the HTML document described below.</p>
<a class="anchor" id="the-directory"></a>
<h2>The Directory</h2>
<p>I want you create and share a directory with a specific name. The name should have the correct casing, and your should use a hypen, not an underscore. For instance, the following are valid folder names:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Isit320-LastName-2017</strong></li>
<li><p><strong>Prog270-LastName-2017</strong></p>
<p>Substitute your last name for the word <strong>LastName</strong>. For instance, I might create a folder called <strong>Isit320-Calvert-2017</strong>.</p>
<p>To share the folder, do one of the following:</p>
</li>
<li><p>Right-click the folder, and choose share</p>
</li>
<li>Select the folder, and choose the Share icon near the top right of the screen</li>
</ul>
<p>Or do something similar if you are working on mobile platform such as a phone or tablet.</p>
<a class="anchor" id="the-google-document"></a>
<h3>The Google Document</h3>
<p>In your folder, create a document called <strong>OnlinePresence-LastName</strong>, where <strong>LastName</strong> is your last name. Example: <strong>OnlinePresence-Calvert</strong>. For now, include at least the following in your document:</p>
<ol>
<li>The email for your Google account.</li>
<li>The URL for your Google Web Site(s)</li>
<li>The URL for any web site your maintain</li>
<li>The URL for your repository</li>
</ol>
<p>Eventually, your document might include additional information in a hyperlinked list elements:</p>
<ol>
<li>The email for your Google account.</li>
<li>The URL for your Google Web Site(s)</li>
<li>The URL for your Twitter Account(s)</li>
<li>The email for your Microsoft Account. Also tell me if you own a copy of Microsoft Office.</li>
<li>The email for your Evernote account</li>
</ol>
<p>In Figure One, I give an example of the type of document I want you to create. Your document will include more data and more links.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/books/CloudNotes/Images/OnlinePresnce01.png" alt="OnlinePresence"></p>
<p>Figure 1: Here is the type of Google Docs file I want you to create. You do not need to use the same colors.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/books/CloudNotes/Images/OnlinePresence02.png" alt="OnlinePresence02.png"></p>
<p>Figure 2: Sharing a document in Google Docs.</p>
<p>The dialog shown in Figure 2  was instantiated when I pushed the Share button seen in the background near the top right of the screen. It will be shared when I enter a valid email address and push the <strong>Send</strong> button. Think long and hard before you enter the email address. <strong><em>Is it the right address</em></strong>?</p>
<a class="anchor" id="google-site-creation"></a>
<h2>Google Site Creation</h2>
<p>Besides creating a document in Google Drive, I also want you to create a <a href="https://sites.google.com/">Google Site</a>. More specifically, I want you to create a <a href="https://sites.google.com/new">New Google Site</a> These sites are free. In my opinion they are not create places to create generic websites, but they are useful when you want to share content creating on with Google Docs, Slides, Sheets, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/elfland/home">https://sites.google.com/view/elfland/home</a></li>
</ul>
<p>After you have created your google account, it takes only a single click to begin creating a web site. Go this site:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sites.google.com/new">https://sites.google.com/new</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Now follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click the red plus button to create a new site</li>
<li>Set your title to Prog270-LastName, or something similar, using your common sense to set the class name and your last name.</li>
<li>Create a simple Google Doc, Google Slide Deck and Google Sheet on Google Drive<ul>
<li>These can be very simple, I won&#39;t be grading you on the content of the documents you create</li>
<li>These will be public documents found on your public Google Site, so don&#39;t put any personal information in them.</li>
<li>Share your documents with everyone</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On your Google Site, choose<ul>
<li><strong>Insert | Google Docs | Docs</strong> to inside your simple document</li>
<li><strong>Insert | Google Docs | Sheets</strong> to insert your spread sheet</li>
<li><strong>Insert | Google Docs | Slides</strong> to insert your slide deck</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Click around some on my Google Site to get a feeling for what I want you to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>My Site: <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/elfland/home">https://sites.google.com/view/elfland/home</a></li>
</ul>
<a class="anchor" id="turn-it-in"></a>
<h2>Turn it In</h2>
<p>The primary content of the assignment, such as the various folders and documents, will appear automatically in my Google, Microsoft, Twitter, and Evernote accounts. Thus there is nothing you absolutely must turn in to canvas other than an acknowledgement that you have completed the assignment. To make the acknowledgement, simply press the submit button in Canvas! Having said this, you might also consider pasting the Online Presence document you put in your Google folder into the Text page of Canvas. On that page, I believe, links are <strong>live</strong> so that I can just click on them.</p>
<p>Though it may be in need of an update, see the following for more information on working with Google Drive:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<a class="anchor" id="what-s-ahead"></a>
<h2>What&#39;s Ahead</h2>
<p>This is the first part of a multi-part series of assignments. Here is a checklist of sorts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Part 01</strong>: (Week02)<ul>
<li>Google Folder</li>
<li>Google Doc</li>
<li>Google Site</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Part 02</strong>: (Week03)<ul>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Bitly</li>

<li>Microsoft Document (Double check that you are using a Microsoft email address!)</li>
<li>OneNote Document (Double check that you are using a Microsoft email address!)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a class="anchor" id="hints-on-google-sites"></a>
<h2>Hints on Google Sites</h2>
<p>Google Sites has changed a great deal since I first wrote this assignment. As mentioned above, I now use it primarily as a means of sharing content I create on Google Drive. But should you want to include a custom HTML page in your site, completing the following steps might still work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Atom and MakeHtml, or StackEdit, or some other set of tools, to convert your markdown to HTML.<ul>
<li>StackEdit: (# menu | Export to Disk | As markdown).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Open the HTML in a text editor such as Geany, NotePad++, CodeAnywhere, nano or Visual Studio. (Wordpad might also work.)</li>
<li>Block Copy the HTML to the clipboard (Ctrl-C).</li>
<li>Open Your Google Site page. Go into edit mode.</li>
<li>Click the little HTML symbol on the top of the page at the right.</li>
<li>Delete any and all HTML shown in the HTML editor.</li>
<li>Paste in your HTML (Ctrl-V).</li>
<li>Save your work.</li>
</ul>
<a class="anchor" id="the-old-google-sites"></a>
<h2>The Old Google Sites</h2>
<p>Google Sites has been radically rewritten. For this assignment, create a new Google Site, as outlined above. But if you want to create an old style site for your personal use, then you can click the create button on this page:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sites.google.com/">https://sites.google.com/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Then follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the blank template (the default)</li>
<li>Name your site. You will be able to edit the name later. (If you need an idea, use <strong>firstnamelastnamebc</strong>. For instance: <strong>charliecalvertbc</strong>.</li>
<li>Create the last word of the URL for your site. Choose a single word using alphanumeric characters. It helps to create a URL that is easy to remember and type. I used <strong>elvenware</strong>.</li>
<li>Choose a theme. This is your choice and can be changed later.</li>
<li>Open up More Options, give your site a description and choose to share it with everyone.</li>
<li>Enter the captcha.</li>
<li>Click Create Site</li>
</ul>
<p>After creating the site choose <strong>Manage Site | General | Mobile | Automatically adjust site to mobile phones</strong>.</p>
<p>If things go completely awry, you will be able to delete the site and start again. In that case, choose <strong>More Actions | Manage Site| Delete Site</strong>.</p>
