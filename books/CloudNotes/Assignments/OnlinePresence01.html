<p>In this class we use a variety of cloud services. Most of these services are free, or very inexpensive. This assignments is designed to help you establish a foothold in these various services.</p>
<p>To enter the world of modern computing, you must have a public presence in the cloud. Most people who fear developing a presence in the cloud exaggerate the importance of the threats they face. One of the main goals in this course is to teach you to use the cloud in a safe, secure and public spirited manner. To get started, you must begin actually participating in a carefully chosen set of cloud services.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <em>While there are some risks involved in using the cloud, most of them can be easily avoided if you follow a few simple practices. In this course, we will learn about these practices.</em></p>
<h2 id="turn-it-in">Turn it In</h2>
<p>This is the first part of a multi-part series of assignments. To help you make sure that you complete everything, here is a checklist of sorts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Part 01: (Week01)<ul>
<li>Google Folder</li>
<li>Google Doc</li>
<li>Google Site</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Part 02: (Week02)<ul>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>EverNote (Double check the email address!)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Part 03: (Week03)<ul>
<li>Microsoft Folder (Double check that you are using a Microsoft email address!)</li>
<li>Microsoft Document (Double check that you are using a Microsoft email address!)</li>
<li>OneNote Document (Double check that you are using a Microsoft email address!)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Turn it in: The primary content of the assignment, such as the various folders and documents, will appear automatically in my Google, Microsoft, Twitter, and Evernote accounts. Thus there is nothing you absolutely must turn in to canvas other than an acknowledgement that you have completed the assignment. To make the acknowledgement, simply press the submit button in Canvas! Having said this, you might also consider pasting the Online Presence document you put in your Google folder into the Text page of Canvas. On that page, I believe, links are <strong>live</strong> so that I can just click on them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sharing">Sharing</h2>
<p><strong>Sharing a document with another person involves associating the document with the right email address</strong>. In this assignment, I spell out the email addresses of mine to use when you share a document with me. Don&#39;t share everything with the same email address. Read the instructions carefully! For Google, use a Google email address when you share the document with me. For Microsoft, use my Microsoft address. There are workarounds, but this is the general goal and best practice. <em>Read each section of the assignment, and find the email address that I want you to use for that portion of the assignment.</em></p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <em>Unless you have done this assignment before, you may well get it kicked back. Perhaps you will get it kicked back more than once. Do your best to fix your errors and then resubmit. <strong>It is only when you resubmit the assignment that I know to check to see if it is now complete so that I can update your grade!</strong> You cannot skip this assignment. To do well in most of my courses you must complete this assignment and complete it correctly.</em></p>
<h2 id="what-account-should-i-use-">What Account Should I Use?</h2>
<p>Some of you may already have accounts for services like Google or Twitter. Should you use that account in this class?</p>
<p>Privacy is a personal subject. Some cloud services, such as Twitter, are very public. What you publish on Twitter for this class will likely be seen by your friends who use Twitter, and vice versa. Some people aren&#39;t bothered by this, others find it upsetting. If you already have an account with any of the services we will use in this class, and you don&#39;t feel comfortable using that same account for your class activities, then I recommend creating a second account with that service.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <em>It is possible to do some things in private on Twitter, and there are valid scenarios for doing so. Nevertheless, in this class will you must use the public interface to Twitter.</em></p>
<p>I find that some tools, such as Google Drive and Microsoft One Drive, do such a good job of helping you separate public and private data, that there is no reason to have two accounts when using those services. However, if you are very fidgety about privacy, or process a lot of information on one of these tools already, then you might still wish to start a new account for this course even if you already have one for that service. Neither Microsoft nor Google have any objection to you maintaining more than one account with their service.</p>
<h2 id="folder-names">Folder names</h2>
<p>This assignment involves creating folders on Google Drive, One Drive and Evernote. The name of your folder should contain three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The year</li>
<li>The class name</li>
<li>Your last name</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are example names for each of my classes, pick the appropriate name for this class:</p>
<ul>
<li>2016-Prog270-LastName</li>
<li>2016-Prog272-LastName</li>
<li>2016-Isit320-LastName</li>
<li>2016-Isit322-LastName</li>
</ul>
<p>Where I write <strong>LastName</strong>, please substitute your last name. For instance, if this class is Prog272, then I would create a folder called <strong>2015-Prog272-Calvert</strong>.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of <strong>improper</strong> folder names:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prog270-LastName -- &gt; <em>Year missing</em></li>
<li>Prog272 --&gt; <em>Year and last name missing</em></li>
<li>2015-Isit320 --&gt; <em>Last name missing</em></li>
<li>2015-PROG270-CALVERT --&gt; <strong>Capitalization (casing) wrong</strong></li>
<li>2015_PROG270_CALVERT --&gt; <strong>Underscore rather than dash and case issues</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you get the casing or name wrong then I might not find your folder at all, and it will certainly cause me extra work to sort through long lists looking for your folder. I depend on folders being sorted properly. If you don&#39;t name your folder properly then it most likely will not be sorted properly.</p>
<p>No one but you and me will ever see these folders. It is not a risk to use your name in their creation.</p>
<h2 id="anonymity">Anonymity</h2>
<p>As described above, always use your real name when creating folders.</p>
<p>Please, if possible, also use your real name or some variant of it when creating new accounts and email addresses.  If you want to use an existing Google or Microsoft account, and your email address for that account does not fit in with my guidelines, then okay, I can live with it. But be sure, be absolutely sure, that when you share your folder with me that you name it correctly, as described in the previous section.</p>
<p>I understand, however, that out of a class of 30 people, one or two of you may have a real reason to want to remain anonymous online. If so, it is okay for you to use a pseudonym on public accounts so long as it is a recognizable variant on your real name. For instance, instead of Calvert, I could Colbert or Clavert.</p>
<p>If you create an email address such as <strong>seattle25\@gmail.com</strong> or a Google Site such as <strong>bc-student-235</strong> or <strong>c00lgal56</strong>, it will be very hard for me to figure out which account to link to which student. Please use your real name or some recognizable variant on your real name.</p>
<p>Some of the services I ask you to use are public, some are not.</p>
<p><strong>Public</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Google Sites</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Private</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Drive</li>
<li>Microsoft One Drive</li>
<li>Evernote</li>
</ul>
<p>When creating accounts on private services you don&#39;t need to worry about including your real name. When creating accounts on public services someone may be able to link an account name to you. This is an extremely, almost vanishingly, small possibility, but it is possible. In those cases, you can use a pseudonym of the type I describe above. If you use a name like <strong>fancydude456</strong>, and the account did not already exist, then I will probably kick the assignment back to you.</p>
<h2 id="should-i-use-a-mobile-device-or-a-desktop-pc-">Should I Use a Mobile Device or a Desktop PC?</h2>
<p>I have chosen the cloud applications used in this assignment because they are useful additions to mobile devices. That does not mean, however, that you have to set up the accounts on those devices.</p>
<p>I use my desktop for tasks like those described here. However, it is possible to complete many of them on a mobile device. Please feel free to try, and if it becomes too frustrating, switch to the desktop.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <em>I wrote the above two paragraphs years ago. In the interim mobile apps have greatly improved. In some cases, teams spend much more time working on their mobile apps than their desk top apps or web interfaces. Also, some users may be more familiar with their mobile device than their computer. Feel free to pick the tools that work best for you.</em></p>
<h2 id="passwords">Passwords</h2>
<p>I have a number of online accounts. To help me manage the passwords for those accounts, I use a service called <a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a>. Getting some people to feel comfortable using services such as Google or Evernote can be difficult, getting them to trust their passwords to LastPass is much more challenging. I believe, however, that allowing LastPass to manage your passwords will prove the most secure solution for most users.</p>
<p>During this quarter, many of you will curse and fret as you attempt to manage your passwords. I have one suggestion: use LastPass or some similar password manager. Two key reasons to use LastPass:</p>
<ul>
<li>During class, I will often ask you to sign on to some particular service. If doing so is difficult or impossible for you, then you will fall behind; you will not be able to follow the steps in my lecture.</li>
<li>If you ask for help, and I stop by your desk, and you cannot sign in to some service we need to use, I tend to just move on to the next student while you solve the problem. This means you won&#39;t get help that you probably need.</li>
</ul>
<p>My suggestion: Create an account with LastPass or some similar service, and learn how to use it!</p>
<p>Be sure also to learn something about the strength of your password by visiting sites like: <a href="https://howsecureismypassword.net/">https://howsecureismypassword.net/</a>.</p>
<h2 id="two-factor-authentication">Two Factor Authentication</h2>
<p>For web sites like Google that may contain a lot of valuable information, consider using two factor authentication. This usually involves entering a password plus entering a code that is texted or emailed to your phone.</p>
<p>Two factor authentication is much, much safer than having a single password. it requires a bit more organization on your part, but it is important that you at least understand that the option exists.</p>
<h2 id="google">Google</h2>
<p>The first step is to create a Google Account if you don&#39;t already have one. Here is a summary of what I want you to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a> and create a google account.  </li>
<li>Set up a gmail account. (<a href="http://www.google.com/mail">http://www.google.com/mail</a>)</li>
<li>Create a Google site (<a href="http://www.google.com/sites">http://www.google.com/sites</a>).</li>
<li>In Google Drive (aka Google Docs) create a Google Folder and share it with me. See above for a description of how to name that folder.</li>
<li>Use the email address shown below when sharing your Google Drive folder. This is not the same address you use when sharing Microsoft folders.</li>
</ul>
<p>The email address to use when sharing your Google Drive folder:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>charliecalvertbc@gmail.com</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In your new folder, create a document called <strong>OnlinePresence-LastName</strong>, where LastName is your last name. It should contain the same information as found in the HTML document described below. When creating documents and folders I will often say that you should name it 201?-???????-LastName. I mean, of course, for you to substitute your last name for the word LastName. For instance, <strong>2016-Isit320-LastName</strong> would become <strong>2016-Isit320-Calvert</strong> in my case.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="the-google-document-assignment">The Google Document Assignment</h2>
<p>This assignment is designed to ensure that you understand Google Drive. Please step carefully through this part of the assignment and make sure you have all the details right.</p>
<p>When you are ready to submit this assignment, name it <strong>OnlinePresence-LastName</strong>, and place it in your Google Docs folder. Please share both the folder and the document with my <strong>charliecalvertbc@gmail.com</strong> account. Be sure I have rights to edit this document, your folder and everything you submit via Google Docs. In general, if you first share the folder with me, then everything you place in the folder should be shared with me automatically.</p>
<h3 id="the-google-document">The Google Document</h3>
<p>Create a document called <strong>OnlinePresence-LastName</strong>, where LastName is your last name. Example: <strong>OnlinePresence-Calvert</strong>. By the time you finish all the parts of this assignment, your document should include the following information in hyperlinked list elements.</p>
<ol>
<li>The email for your Google account.</li>
<li>The URL for your Google Web Site(s)</li>
<li>The URL for your Twitter Account(s)</li>
<li>The email for your Microsoft Account. Also tell me if you own a copy of Microsoft Office.</li>
<li>The email for your Evernote account</li>
</ol>
<p>This part of this assignment, only involves the first two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>The email for your Google account.</li>
<li>The URL for your Google Web Site(s)</li>
</ol>
<p>In Figure One, I give an example of the type of document I want you to create. Your document will include more data and more links.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/books/CloudNotes/Images/OnlinePresnce01.png" alt="OnlinePresence"></p>
<p>Figure 1: Here is the type of Google Docs file I want you to create. You do not need to use the same colors.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/books/CloudNotes/Images/OnlinePresence02.png" alt="OnlinePresence02.png"></p>
<p>Figure 2: Sharing a document in Google Docs.</p>
<p>The dialog shown in Figure 2  was instantiated when I pushed the Share button seen in the background near the top right of the screen. It will be shared when I enter a valid email address and push the <strong>Send</strong> button. Think long and hard before you enter the email address. <strong><em>Is it the right address</em></strong>?</p>
<h2 id="google-site-creation">Google Site Creation</h2>
<p>Besides creating a document in Google Drive, I also want you to create a Google Site. This is a free web site that you can use to publish data or to experiment with web services. Here is the URL of my site, so that you can have an example of what I&#39;m asking you to do:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/elvenware/">https://sites.google.com/site/elvenware/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>After you have created your google account, it takes only a single click to begin creating a web site. After clicking the button you should choose to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the blank template (the default)</li>
<li>Name your site. You will be able to edit the name later. (If you need an idea, use <strong>firstnamelastnamebc</strong>. For instance: <strong>charliecalvertbc</strong>.</li>
<li>Create the last word of the URL for your site. Choose a single word using alphanumeric characters. It helps to create a URL that is easy to remember and type. I used <strong>elvenware</strong>.</li>
<li>Choose a theme. This is your choice and can be changed later.</li>
<li>Open up More Options, give your site a description and choose to share it with everyone.</li>
<li>Enter the captcha.</li>
<li>Click Create Site</li>
</ul>
<p>After creating the site choose <strong>More Actions | Manage Site | Automatically Adjust Site to Mobile Phones</strong>.</p>
<p>If things go completely awry, you will be able to delete the site and start again. In that case, choose <strong>More Actions | Manage Site| Delete Site</strong>.</p>
