<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The goal of this assignment is to set up a Virtual Machine containing an Ubuntu Server instance and to communicate to it from your Pristine Ubuntu Desktop. Link to this document:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://bit.ly/linux-server-basics">http://bit.ly/linux-server-basics</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In this assignment you will learn how to use SSH to communicate between two Linux instances. You can use these same technology to communicate between machines that are running on the same network, or between machines on two different networks in very different locations. For instance, you can SSH between a machine in Bellevue and another machine running on an AWS server in Portland.</p>
<a class="anchor" id="important-commands"></a>
<h2>Important Commands</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update: sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade</li>
<li>Shutdown the server: <strong>sudo shutdown -h now</strong></li>
</ul>
<a class="anchor" id="get-started"></a>
<h2>Get Started</h2>
<p>If you are in Pristine Lubuntu, switch back to Windows for this opening part of the exercise.</p>
<p>Download the 1 GB OVA file for the Ubuntu Linux Server 16.04 with CouchDb to your Windows machine. Don&#39;t download it into Prisitine Lubuntu. The OVA file can be found here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://bit.ly/pristine-ubuntu-server-16-10">http://bit.ly/pristine-ubuntu-server-16-10</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I have created an OVA file for use in VirtualBox, VMware, etc. The OVA is perhaps 2 GB in size, so be prepared for a significant download.</p>
<p>Be sure you install the VirtualBox Extension Pack for your instance. It is available from the VirtualBox download page. I have only tested it in VirtualBox but it should work in VMware.</p>
<p>Once you have downloaded the file choose the following from the VirtualBox menu: <strong>File | Import Appliance</strong>.  This will allow you to add the Ubuntu Server to your VirtualBox Manager. Double clicking the OVA file in the Windows Explorer also works.</p>
<p>When importing the OVA, <em><strong>be sure to reset the MAC address</strong></em>.</p>
<p>This Ubuntu Server VM is configured to use 2 GB of RAM, but you can change this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Close your instance of the VM (sudo shutdown -h now)</li>
<li>Select your instance in VirtualBox</li>
<li>Go to Settings | System</li>
<li>Change the amount of RAM to 1024 or 768. These smaller numbers may affect performance, but the VM should still work. It can allow you to run the server on underpowered machines. Ubuntu server does not take a lot of resources, and hence works on even very old laptops.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you first start your instance, you may get a warning about the network interface. A dialog will appear asking you to update your settings. Select the <strong>Change Network Settings</strong> button. You shouldn&#39;t need to do anything in the dialog that VirtualBox then displays. The correct network interface should be selected automatically. Just press the OK button. Now restart your instance if it does not restart automatically.</p>

<p>In the picture shown below the error has been resolved automatically. Just press the OK button and Bob&#39;s your uncle.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket01.elvenware.com/images/virtualbox-error-resolve.png" alt="network error resolved"></p>
<a class="anchor" id="ip-address"></a>
<h2>Find your IP Address</h2>
<p>We will want to connect to this server instance for several reasons. Among the most important:</p>
<ul>
<li>So we can access this server from inside Pristine Lubuntu<ul>
<li>This includes reaching the CLI of the server</li>
<li>And transferring files to or from the server</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The SSH interface to the server is, from my point of view at least, much easier to use than the default interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>To connect to this instance using SSH we need to know its IP address. Type <strong>ifconfig</strong> (or <strong>ipconfig</strong> on Windows) to find your ip address.</p>
<pre>$ ifconfig

</pre>
<p>The IP address appears on about the third line of the example shown above. In this case it is <strong>192.168.2.21</strong>. This is a typical example of the type of address you will see at home. At school, it might look more like <strong>168.156.43.123</strong>. But the number can, and usually will, be different on your system.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <em>Sometimes, if you get an address that starts with 10, that means you have selected <strong>NAT</strong> rather than <strong>Bridged Adapter</strong> in the VirtualBox network settings for your VM. We should use <strong>Bridged Adaptor</strong> for this assignment.</em></p>
<p>At home, you will probably only need to discover the IP address for your server one time. But at school, this address may change each time you close and restart your ubuntu server. Perhaps on any one day it will stay the same, but if you close your server, then restart it again several days later, you will likely be assigned a new IP address by the school DHCP servers. This is normal behavior.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <em>It is possible to tell a DHCP server to always give a particular machine a particular IP address. Nevertheless, there is no harm, and some advantage, in being forced to think about and work with IP addresses at least once a day.</em></p>
<a class="anchor" id="ssh-first"></a>
<h2>SSH First Time</h2>
<p>Open up Pristine Lubuntu if you have not done so already. Go to the command line and SSH into your server with a command something like this:</p>
<pre>$ ssh bcuser@192.168.2.21
</pre>
<p>You will, of course, have to adjust the IP address. Set it to the IP of your Ubuntu Server instance:</p>
<pre>ssh bcuser@<REMOTE HOST IP>
</pre>
<p>Of course the user name will not always be <strong>bcuser</strong>. For instance, when logging into AWS the default user name is <strong>ubuntu</strong>. As a result, we might express the formula for logging into a remote machine with SSH like this:</p>
<pre>ssh <USERNAME>@<HOST NAME OR IP>
</pre>
<p>Below you see an example of using the ssh command to access the machine running on the IP address <strong>192.168.2.21</strong>. We are signing into the machine with the user name <strong>bcuser</strong>. The process should look something like this:</p>
<pre>$ ssh bcuser@192.168.2.21
bcuser@192.168.2.21's password:

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <em>Remember that in Linux, you usually get no feedback when entering a password in the bash shell. As a result, some users get the impression that they are not able to enter a password. That is not the case. You just need to keep typing even though you are not getting any feedback, even though you are not getting any indication that you are in fact typing your password.</em></p>
<p>Once you are logged into the remote server, you can do everything that you can at the Pristine Lubuntu bash command prompt. The only difference is that you cannot, at least by default, open a GUI application. In particular, you cannot open <strong>geany</strong>. Instead, you should use an editor called <strong>nano</strong> that is installed by default on nearly on Ubuntu flavors of Linux. Indeed, the editor is available on most Linux distros.</p>
<a class="anchor" id="setting-up-ssh"></a>
<h2>Setting up SSH</h2>
<p>Once we confirm that we can access our server, the next step is to set up our SSH key so that we don&#39;t need to type our password ever time we SSH into a server, or ever time we copy files into or from the server. The basic procedure is simple: _simply copy your public key into the <strong>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</strong> file for your server_. This, or some similar process, is what happens when we paste our public key into a dialog on GitHub or BitBucket.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: _I assume that this is exactly what happens on GitHub or BitBucket, but I haven&#39;t seen their internal process so I don&#39;t know for sure. But I assume that our public key goes directly into an <strong>authorized_keys</strong> file when we press save in their dialog. If this is not what happens, then it would only be because they have developed some optimized way of performing the same task. In general, however, the proper solution is to use <strong>authorized_keys</strong>, and indeed I know of no other solution._</p>
<p>In order to put the key into the remote machine, there are two standard techniques:</p>
<ol>
<li>In scenario one, we use the ssh-copy-id command to copy the key from our desktop to the server in a single step</li>
<li>In scenario two, we perform the same action manually. In particular, we use SSH secure copy (scp) to copy our key to the remote machine. We then copy the key into the <strong>authorized_keys</strong> file.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is the code to copy the key to our server  in a single step.</p>
<pre>ssh-copy-id bcuser@192.168.2.21
</pre>
<p><strong>note</strong>: <em>You will very likely need to change the IP address from 192.168.2.21 to the IP address of your server.</em></p>
<p>The <strong>ssh-copy-id</strong> command copies the default public key over to the remote machine. The default public key is usually <strong>id_rsa.pub</strong>. I find it safer to specify which key I want to copy over. To do that, use the <strong>-i</strong> flag. Generally, that command looks like this, where <strong>identity-file</strong> is your private key:</p>
<pre>ssh-copy-id -i identity_file bcuser@192.168.2.21
</pre>
<p>For instance, if you have private key called <strong>prog270-2016</strong> then you would issue this command:</p>
<pre>ssh-copy-id -i prog270-2016 bcuser@192.168.2.21
</pre>
<p>Alternatively, if you don&#39;t want to use ssh-copy-id, you can use <strong>scp</strong> instead. From your instance of Pristine Lubuntu use SSH to <em>secure copy</em> (scp) your public key from pristine Lubuntu to your EC2 instance:</p>
<pre>scp <YOUR-PUBLIC-KEY> ubuntu@<YOUR-ELASTIC-IP>:/home/ubuntu/.ssh/.
</pre>
<p>Then on EC2 append your public key to your <strong>authorized keys file</strong>:</p>
<pre>cat ~/.ssh/<YOUR-PUBLIC-KEY> >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
</pre>
<p>Whether you use <strong>ssh-copy-id</strong> or <strong>scp</strong> to put your public key in the EC2 <strong>authorized_keys</strong> file is mostly a matter of taste. However, the <strong>ssh-copy-id</strong> program is a bit safer. For instance, it checks to make sure you are not putting duplicate keys in the <strong>authorized_keys</strong> file.</p>
<p>Here are some alternative commands for copying the file to the remote machine:</p>
<pre>cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@hostname 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@123.45.56.78 "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >>  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh <user>@<hostname> 'umask 0077; mkdir -p .ssh; cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys && echo "Key copied"'
</pre>
<a class="anchor" id="no-passwords"></a>
<h2>No Passwords</h2>
<p>We use SSH keys in part to avoid being prompted for passwords. In particular, to avoid being prompted for passwords, two conditions must be met:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our private key must be loaded on the desktop PC with <strong>sshadd</strong>﻿ or <strong>ssh-add</strong>.</li>
<li>The corresponding public key must be stored properly in the <strong>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</strong> file on the Ubuntu server.</li>
</ul>
<a class="anchor" id="scp"></a>
<h2>Copy a File with scp</h2>
<p>To complete the process, let&#39;s make sure that you know how to copy a file from one machine to another. First, switch your Pristine Lubuntu desktop. Create a disposable file called <strong>LinuxServerTest.md</strong> with the <strong>echo</strong> command, then copy it to the remote machine:</p>
<pre>echo '## My Title' >> LinuxServerTest.md
scp LinuxServerTest.md bcuser@192.168.2.21:/home/bcuser/.
</pre>
<p>The whole process might look something like this:</p>
<pre>charlie@rohan-elf:~/.ssh
$ cd
charlie@rohan-elf:~
$ cd temp/
charlie@rohan-elf:~/temp
$ echo '## My Title' >> LinuxServerTest.md
charlie@rohan-elf:~/temp
$ scp LinuxServerTest.md bcuser@192.168.2.21:/home/bcuser/.
LinuxServerTest.md            100%   12     0.0KB/s   00:00
charlie@rohan-elf:~/temp
</pre>
<p>Now ssh to the remote machine and check that the file has been copied correctly:</p>
<pre>$ ssh bcuser@192.168.2.21

bcuser@ubs:~$ cat LinuxServerTest.md
## My Title
</pre>
<a class="anchor" id="turn-it-in"></a>
<h2>Turn it in</h2>
<p>Perform the actions described in the section called <a href="#scp">Copy a File with scp</a>. Only this time, call the file <strong>LinuxServer-LastName.md</strong> and set the title to your last name:</p>
<pre>echo '## LastName' >> LinuxServer-LastName.md
</pre>
<p>Copy the file from your desktop to your remote machine. SSH to your remote machine and <strong>cat</strong> the contents of your copied file.</p>
<p>Take a screen shot or two, as necessary, and attach them to the assignment when you turn it in. I&#39;m looking for evidence that you can use the <strong>ssh</strong> and <strong>scp</strong> command without being prompted for a password. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>A screenshot of your Pristine Lubuntu terminal just after you copy a file to the server.</li>
<li>A screenshot of your Ubuntu Server showing<ul>
<li>the contents of your .ssh directory</li>
<li>A listing (with ls or ll) showing the files you copied over from Pristine Lubuntu</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a class="anchor" id="low-memory"></a>
<h2>Low Memory</h2>
<p>You can tell how much memory an Ubuntu/Lubuntu instance is using with the free command:</p>
<pre>charlie@CedarJuju:~$ free -h  
  total used free shared buff/cache available  
  Mem: 2.0G 35M 1.8G 3.1M 125M 1.8G  
  Swap: 2.0G 0B 2.0G
</pre>
<p>The example above shows that this instance is only using 35 MB, leaving 1.8 GB free. In short, you can run one of the servers in small amounts of memory and they will still work. Here I run the server with 250 MB of memory (RAM) allocated to it:</p>
<pre>charlie@CedarJuju:~$ free -h  
  total used free shared buff/cache available  
  Mem: 230M 29M 77M 1.6M 123M 181M  
  Swap: 2.0G 0B 2.0G
</pre>
<p>To change this setting, stop the server, choose settings for the VM in the VirtualBox manager, and select the <strong>System</strong> page.</p>
