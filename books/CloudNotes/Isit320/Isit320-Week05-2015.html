<p>Provide a link to the Profile page on Code Academy account showing 
that you have taken:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web Fundamentals: 100%</li>

<p>Please put your picture in your Code Academy site, or link to your 
Google Site, or provide some other means of clearly linking yourself 
to the URL you provide.</p>
<h3 id="assignment-02-gitignore">Assignment 02: GitIgnore</h3>
<p>When working in your repository, there are some files that you probably
don&#39;t want to check in. These include any files
in the following directories:</p>
<pre><code>.metadata
.c9revisions
node_modules
</code></pre><p>If you have already checked in these files to your repository, it is
simpler to leave there than to remove them. Nevertheless, you can
ensure that your folders don&#39;t get an larger than they are now.</p>
<p>Create a file called .gitignore. That&#39;s GITIGNORE with a PERIOD in front
of it: .gitignore.</p>
<p>Create or open the file in your editor. This sounds like a simple 
thing, but on Linux or Cloud 9, files that begin with a period are 
hidden. Right click on your folder in Cloud 9, and choose show 
hidden files. In Linux, type <strong>ls -la</strong> to see hidden files. </p>
<p>Inside gitignore add the following three lines:</p>
<pre><code>.metadata
.c9revisions
node_modules
</code></pre><p>The first folder holds information used workspaces in 
Eclipse/Aptana. The second folder holds backup copies of files you 
have edited on Cloud 9, and the third holds libraries used by Node. 
None of these directories needs to be stored on GitHub.</p>
<p>Add and check in your .gitignore file:</p>
<pre><code>add .gitignore
commit -m &quot;Adding GitIgnore File&quot;
git push
</code></pre><p>When you are done, submit the URL of your repository.</p>
<h3 id="assignment-03-project-names">Assignment 03: Project Names</h3>
<p>This is busy work, but it is very helpful to me if you create 
useful names for your projects in Aptana. Here is the contents of 
a typical .project file that is used by Eclipse/Aptana to define
the name of your project:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;projectDescription&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;week3&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;comment&gt;&lt;/comment&gt;
        &lt;projects&gt;
        &lt;/projects&gt;
        &lt;buildSpec&gt;
                &lt;buildCommand&gt;
                        &lt;name&gt;com.aptana.ide.core.unifiedBuilder&lt;/name&gt;
                        &lt;arguments&gt;
                        &lt;/arguments&gt;
                &lt;/buildCommand&gt;
        &lt;/buildSpec&gt;
        &lt;natures&gt;
                &lt;nature&gt;com.aptana.projects.webnature&lt;/nature&gt;
        &lt;/natures&gt;
&lt;/projectDescription&gt;
</code></pre><p>When I open this project in Aptana, it is called <strong>week3</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;name&gt;week3&lt;/name&gt;
</code></pre><p>There are three problems with names like this in the context of our
course:</p>
<ol>
<li>I can&#39;t tell whose project it is. Week3, yes, but Week3 by which 
student? </li>
<li>Each project name in Aptana needs to be unique. If you submit a 
project named <strong>week3</strong>, and student x also submits a project with 
the name <strong>week3</strong>, then Aptana balks. I have to open the 
appropriate <strong>.project</strong> file, edit the name, and try again to import it. </li>
<li>There might be multiple submissions for one week, and so naming 
the project week3 doesn&#39;t tell me which assignment from week3 is in 
the project folder.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please go through all the .project files in your repository and set
their names using the following style:</p>
<ul>
<li>LastName-WeekXX-AssignmentName</li>
</ul>
<p>You should be able to right click on the projects in Aptana/Eclipse
and rename them directly. This should change the contents of your
.project files, but please check to make sure that it does. If you
change the name of a project that has already been imported into 
Aptana by editing the .project file, then the next time you open 
Aptana you won&#39;t be able to open that particular project. You should
then delete the project from Aptana and reimport it, or do something
similar that has the same affect.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: When cleaning up, you may decide to rename some of your 
folders. That kind of renaming is not really a necessary part of the 
assignment, but it can be useful to both you and me. When you rename 
a folder, remember to do it with git: <strong>git mv Week01 
Week01-ForLoops</strong>. That command would rename a folder called 
<strong>Week01</strong> to <strong>Week01-ForLoops</strong>. If you don&#39;t ask Git to perform 
this task, and do it instead with the Windows Explorer or Windows 
command tools, then Git will think you deleted Week01 and created a 
new folder called <strong>Week01-ForLoops</strong>. That can cause no end of
problems for you.</p>
<p>If you opt to edit the .project files directly, or you want to check 
your work, here is one entirely optional way to proceed. At the 
command prompt:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the root of your repository</li>
<li>Enter this command: <strong>dir /s /b .project &gt; openProjects.bat</strong></li>
<li>Edit openProjects.bat in NotePad++</li>
<li>Use the regular expression shown below to tell NotePad++ to open
all your .project files.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: npp.bat is a batch file that I have on my path that points
to notepad++. Here is the contents of that batch file:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++\Notepad++.exe&quot; %1 %1 %1
</code></pre><p>Here is how to search and replace using regular expressions in 
NotePad++:</p>
<p><img src="../Images/RegEx01.png" alt="RegEx01"></p>
<p>**Figure01: See the <a href="../Images/RegEx01.png">full size image</a></p>
<p>Here is the regex:</p>
<ul>
<li>^: Go to the beginning of the line</li>
<li>(.*): Capture all the text on that line in a variable called \1</li>
<li>call npp: Enter the letters npp as literals. Or call npp.bat if you prefer.</li>
<li>\1: paste in the contents of the \1 variable, which is set to .*</li>
</ul>
<p>So a RegEx of <strong>^(.*)</strong> captures a line of text</p>
<p>And this RegEx replaces it with npp plus the captured line of text: <strong>call npp \1</strong></p>
<p>RegEx is a bit terse, and you don&#39;t really have to understand it. But
it is nice to know.</p>
<p>Here is what openProjects.bat looked like in one repository before
I edited it using search and replace as shown in the image:</p>
<pre><code>C:\Src\Git\Isit320\A01\ISIT320-XXX\week1\ArrayTwoDimensions\.project
C:\Src\Git\Isit320\A01\ISIT320-XXX\week1\Branching01\.project

C:\Src\Git\Isit320\A01\ISIT320-XXX\week2\.project
C:\Src\Git\Isit320\A01\ISIT320-XXX\week3\.project
</code></pre><p>Here is what it looked like after edit it with the regular expression
shown in the image:</p>
<pre><code>npp C:\Src\Git\Isit320\A01\ISIT320-XXX\week1\ArrayTwoDimensions\.project
npp C:\Src\Git\Isit320\A01\ISIT320-XXX\week1\Branching01\.project
npp C:\Src\Git\Isit320\A01\ISIT320-XXX\week1\ForLoopNested\.project
npp C:\Src\Git\Isit320\A01\ISIT320-XXX\week1\Loops01\.project
npp C:\Src\Git\Isit320\A01\ISIT320-XXX\week1\PrimitiveTypes\.project
npp C:\Src\Git\Isit320\A01\ISIT320-XXX\week2\.project
npp C:\Src\Git\Isit320\A01\ISIT320-XXX\week3\.project
</code></pre><p>Once it was edited, I could just run the batch file and all the 
project files opened in NotePad++. Here is what it looked like:</p>
<p><img src="../Images/RegEx02.png" alt="NotePad++MultiEdit"></p>
<p><strong>Figure02: Open seven tabs at once in NotePad++. <a href="../Images/RegEx02.png">See big image</a></strong></p>
<p>When you are done, check in your work and submit the URL of your 
repository. I know this is busy work, and I should have made all this 
clear earlier, but lets straighten it out now. Thank you.</p>
<h3 id="assignment-04-roll-dice">Assignment 04: Roll Dice</h3>
<p>Create a program that simulates rolling dice. We will need to roll
a wide array of dice. Here is how it works.</p>
<p>The kind of die you see most often has six possible values:</p>
<pre><code>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
</code></pre><p>This kind of die is called a d6 </p>
<p>In most games we play, there are 2 d6 dice. This is called 2d6:</p>
<pre><code>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
</code></pre><p>For instance the first die might roll a 2, and the second a 6, this 
would return a value of 8. It is not possible for a d6 die to return 
0 or 7.</p>
<p>We will also need 3 6 sided dice, which is called 3d6:</p>
<pre><code>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
</code></pre><p>But not all dice have 6 sides. Some, for instance, have four. This kind
of die is called a d4:</p>
<pre><code>1, 2, 3, 4
</code></pre><p>And of course tehre are d10s with possible return values between
1 and 10 inclusive, and d20s, with possible return values between
1 and 20 inclusive.</p>
<p>I want you to create a program with 6 buttons on it. Each button
will return the result of a different kind of dice roll:</p>
<ul>
<li>Button01: D6</li>
<li>Button02: 2D6</li>
<li>Button03: 3D6</li>
<li>Button04: D4</li>
<li>Button05: D10</li>
<li>Button06: D20</li>
</ul>
<p>For the 2D6 and 3D6 rolls, I want you to display not only the result
of the roll, but the actual value that each die returned:</p>
<p><img src="../Images/Dice01.png" alt="A roll of the 3D6"></p>
<p><strong>Figure01: Three dice were rolled. They returned a 5, 1, and 3 for a 
total of 9.</strong> <a href="../Images/Dice01.png">See full size</a></p>
<p>Your solution should be more complex than this. I&#39;m
only showing the results for one sixth of the answer in this 
screen shot.</p>
<p>I want you to also run tests that confirm that over 250 rolls, each 
of your rolls return values that are within the appropriate range.
For instance, You should roll your 2D6 dice 250 times and confirm
that the result is always between 1 and 12, inclusive. You don&#39;t need
to write 250 tests, you just call your roll 250 times and confirm
that it never returns a value outside the range. If it does return a
value outside the range, then the test should fail, otherwise, it 
passes.</p>
<p>Here is how to roll a D3:</p>
<pre><code>var rollD3 = function() {
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * 3) + 1;
};
</code></pre><p>I think you can figure it all out from there. To return a six sided
die roll, multiply by 6, not by 3. To return the result of rolling
two six sided dice, call rollD6() twice, and add up the results. And
so on. Or do something altogether different, if you prefer. Its all
good so long as it works, and it isn&#39;t too verbose.</p>
<p>When rolling a 2D6 you would also want to tuck the values returned 
by each die away somewhere so you can display them to the user. 
Whether you just store the result of the two rolls in a single 
string, or in two separate number variables is up to you.</p>
<p>I stumbled across a nice little bug when I first started writing this
code. Suppose you tried to call the results of a roll directly in an 
angular place holder:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;{{getD3Roll()}}&lt;p&gt;
</code></pre><p>Angular will execute callD3Roll() which in turn calls your rollD3() 
function. Then every so often Angular checks to see if anything has 
changed by executing one of its watch() methods. Since the 
callD3Roll() function returns a random number, Angular will 
frequently find that the result has changed. I think in this case we 
have a 1 in 3 chance of the number not changing. So it updates the 
View. Then it checks to see if the value has changed. Whoops. It&#39;s 
changed, so it updates the view. And so on. If this happens often 
enough, it will assume it is stuck in some kind of loop, and start 
malfunctioning. You might not notice the errors unless you have your 
console view open in the debugger. But my experience shows that it 
will start malfunctioning if you do something like this.</p>
<p>The solution, of course, is to never call the rollD3 function that 
way. Instead, just call it on a button click:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;button ng-click=&#39;getD3Roll()&#39;&gt;Roll D3&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre><p>This puts the onus on the user to check for a new value, rather than 
on Angular itself. And of course you have to figure out some way
of getting the answer back into the view, but I&#39;ll let you figure out
a good way to solve that problem. The key point is that the button
click solution ensures that a new value appears only when the 
user requests it. Now Angular is happy, and the errors go away.</p>
<p>Put your implementation in a your repo in a folder called 
<strong>Week05-RollDice</strong> and submit the URL for your repo.</p>
