    <h1>Faculty Introductions</h1>

    Your course is being taught by Charlie Calvert. It is based, however, on a course written by Ron Austin, so I
    include his bio as well.

    <p>Hi, I'm Charlie Calvert and I'm your teacher. </p>
    <p>I've been working with computers and writing code in one form or another for about 30 years. I started out with
        Turbo
        Pascal and Delphi, spent time with Java, C++, Python, and Perl, and then spent a number of years working in C#.
        I've
        spent most of my career in industry, working first for Borland, then for a start-up in Silicon Valley, and until
        a
        few years ago I was at Microsoft on the C# team. Over the last few years, I've been interested primarily in
        Agile
        Development, the cloud and various mobile devices.</p>
    <p>In this class, I'm looking forward to exploring the ways we write
        web and mobile applications. I'm also looking to learn new ways to use virtual machines,
        cloud resources, and mobile devices.</p>
    <p>I enjoy hiking, snow-shoeing, swimming, reading and watching movies. I also
        like to write. I'm known in the computer world primarily as a book author:</p>

    <p>My professional passions are <strong>Instructional Design, Programming, and Digital
        Media.</strong> I earned my BA at The Evergreen State College in 1991 where I studied communications and
        computer science. I received a Master of Education from the University of Washington in 2005.</p>
    <p>I attended Bellevue College as a student in the late 1990s to earn a certificate in Web Authoring. After I
        graduated from BC I contracted with multiple places including Microsoft, GoMobile, Limelight Media, The Creative
        Group, William Meacham Insurance, and The Museum of Radio and Electricity. My work has varied between
        client-side web development and video editing.<strong>I am currently the E-Learning Specialist with the
            Healthcare Informatics BAS Program at Bellevue College.</strong> This gives me a lot of opportunity to
        use HTML and Javascript on a daily basis.</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve been an instructor since 2000. The subjects that I have taught vary quite a bit between web
        development, animation, and history of film for example.</p>
    <p>On the personal side of things I enjoy getting outside hiking and running around. I try to
        participate in several 5k &amp; 10ks a year. I bike and ski if the weather is not too rainy. I also have a
        kid who turned 18 this year and rides a unicycle and skateboards a lot.</p>
