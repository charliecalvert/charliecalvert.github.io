        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Use the markup skills you learned during the first week of class to create a one page HTML document with an accompanying CSS file. The HTML document should contain your resume. Try to write something useful, but don't fuss over it unduly. The key to success is iteration. At first, aim only to create a rough draft. For inspiration, review the example provided below; you can use elements from it but don't make your resume look the same!</p>
        <p>Use the HTML tags covered in the last assignment, plus the <strong>link</strong>, <strong>ul</strong>, and <strong>li</strong> tags. Craft your page by hand. Don't use a tool or service to help you create the document and then say "Save as HTML." Build it yourself by hand. If it's got a lot of weird tags in it that we haven't discussed, I'll notice and grade accordingly.</p>
        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The content should look reasonably okay on both a desktop and mobile device. Do the best you can even if the result is not as well formatted as you may wish. Be patient. We will iterate later until we get it right.</p> 
            Just submit&nbsp;an <strong>html</strong> and <strong>css</strong> document at this time. It does not have to be hosted on a web server yet.&nbsp;</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Requirements:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The code should formatted appropriately formatted using the tags from the previous assignment.<em> <br /></em></li>
            <li>Utilize at least <strong>one </strong>unordered list.</li>
            <li>You may include images, but you are not required to do so.</li>
            <li>Specify your name, work history, skills summary, and education (see the example below).</li>
            <li>Use your real name. List an address and phone contact, but it does not need to be authentic.</li>
            <li>Link in a CSS file called <strong>styles.css.</strong> In it define the following rule:</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="code">body {<br />&nbsp; font-size: 133%;<br />&nbsp; font-family: sans-serif;<br />}<br /></pre>
        <p>As you can see, I like large fonts! My eyes tire easily, so I use the tools to make my life easier. </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Turn it in</h2>
        <p>Upload your HTML document&nbsp;to the&nbsp;assignment area by the due date. You may <strong>not</strong> compress the file as a zip. Just attach the raw html and css files.</p>
        <h2>Example Resume</h2>
        
        <p>Below you will find an example resume on which you can base portions of your work. Readability is the key -- you really want that job at Microsft, Amazon, Google or a startup.</p>
