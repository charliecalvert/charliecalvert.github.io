<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This is the Midterm for Prog 109 in 2018.</p>
<p>The goal of the midterm is for each student to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a theme for a web site</li>
<li>Develop at least seven completed web pages at least five of which contain pictures.  </li>
<li>Create the web pages using Visual Studio Code or your editor of choices. The pages of the site should use HTML5 code.</li>
<li>Make sure each page has a:<ul>
<li>header</li>
<li>nav (perhaps not needed on your About page.)</li>
<li>main</li>
<li>footer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Display the web site on your GitHub Pages site.</li>
<li>Ensure that your theme pages are linked from your GitHub Pages home page.<ul>
<li>Link to the home page of your Theme, and from there link to the individual pages your created.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>View the site on an emulated phone and if possible on a real phone. Make at least minimal corrections to ensure it looks good. We have not solved all problems related to phones yet, particularly when it comes to NAV sections. Just do the best you can given the technology we have covered so far. Don&#39;t try to fix everything by searching across the web. I&#39;m expecting these pages to not be fully polished yet. Polishing them will be part of the final.</li>
<li>Include at least one image that you float to the left or right on at least three pages.</li>
<li>Include at least one <strong>aside</strong> that you float to the left or right.</li>
<li>Include examples of paragraphs, headers (h1, h2, etc) and unordered or ordered lists on several of your pages.</li>
<li>Include an <strong>About</strong> page with your picture on it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a step by step outline of what needs to be done to move your WebSite from Pristine Lubuntu to EC2. The process seems a bit complex at first, but the steps can be mastered if you approach them one at time. Here they are in English, as a counterpoint to your good command list:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create your web pages and test each one locally before uploading it. (Choose Ctrl + O to open the page in your browser).</li>
<li>Push your repository</li>
<li>Make sure it looks right on your GitHub Pages site.<ol>
<li>Sunday and Monday there were technical problems with GitHub pages, but they have been resolved.</li>
<li>If you suspect problems are recurring, go to the <a href="https://status.github.com/messages">GitHub Status page</a>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<a class="anchor" id="theme"></a>
<h2>Step One: Theme</h2>
<p>Pick a subject that you want for your web site. I don&#39;t care what subject you pick. It could be any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A technical interest such as JavaScript, web development, linux, Windows, etc.</li>
<li>A resume and expanded BIO.</li>
<li>Favorite Music</li>
<li>Favorite Books</li>
<li>Favorite Movies</li>
<li>Hobbies</li>
<li>Outdoor interests such as hiking or sports.</li>
<li>Other Interests</li>
</ul>
<p>The most important thing is that it holds your interest. It should be something that you are passionate about, or sincerely attracts your interest.</p>
<a class="anchor" id="pages"></a>
<h2>Step Two: Pages</h2>
<p>The theme pages on your GitHub pages site should contain at least three directories: the root folder and at least two sub-directories. For instance, if your theme was <strong>West Coast States</strong>, you might have three subdirectories:</p>
<ul>
<li>California</li>
<li>Oregon</li>
<li>Washington</li>
</ul>
<p>Put at least one page in each sub-directory and link to it from your theme home page.</p>
<p>Five of the pages should have bitmaps on them. The images should be ones that you took yourself, or ones that are clearly marked as released under the Creative Commons license. Do not include an proprietary images belonging to someone other than yourself.</p>
<ul>
<li>You should display at least 10 images one your theme pages. Any particular page may have zero or only one image. However, across all seven pages there should be at least 10 different images displayed.</li>
<li>At least two of the bitmaps must be served from your <strong>images</strong> directory.</li>
<li><p>At least one picture should be served from the WikiMedia site and be from a public domain source (Creative Commons) source.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.ccalvert.net/books/CloudNotes/Assignments/Ec2MarkdownToHtml.html#bitmaps">Learn to use WikiMedia Images</a></p>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/concerned-copyright-guide-legally-using-images-web/">Understanding Copyright Issues</a></li>
</ul>
<a class="anchor" id="create-site"></a>
<h2>Step Three: Create Site</h2>
<p>By now, you all should be familiar with the process of pushing your pages to GitHub and viewing them on the GitHub Pages site.</p>
<p>Be sure, however, to create a home page for both your theme and for your entire site. By default, the page in the root of your repository called <strong>index.html</strong> is your home page. The page in the root of your <strong>theme</strong> directory is the home page for your theme.</p>
<p>The contents of <strong>index.html</strong> should contain links that point directly to pages in your root folder and to the <strong>index.html</strong> file in your <strong>theme</strong>, <strong>ListButton</strong> and other subdirectories that contain code you have created. On your site Home Page, I want to see links to not only your theme folder, but all the assignments we have created so far in this course.</p>
<p>Since a web server such as the one on GitHub Pages will automatically load <strong>index.html</strong> as a default page, your links can simple point to the <strong>theme</strong> or <strong>ListButton</strong> directory. You don&#39;t have to point them to <strong>theme/index.html</strong>. Remember, this will work properly on GitHub Pages, but it probably won&#39;t work when your load page directly into your browser with <strong>Ctrl + O</strong>.</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-variable">&amp;lt</span>;a href=<span class="hljs-string">"/theme"</span><span class="hljs-variable">&amp;gt</span>;Theme<span class="hljs-variable">&amp;lt</span>;/a<span class="hljs-variable">&amp;gt</span>;

<span class="hljs-params">&lt;a href="/theme"&gt;</span>Theme<span class="hljs-params">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p>You don&#39;t have to do this, though it is not wrong:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-variable">&amp;lt</span>;a href=<span class="hljs-string">"/theme/index.html"</span><span class="hljs-variable">&amp;gt</span>;Theme<span class="hljs-variable">&amp;lt</span>;/a&gt;

<span class="hljs-params">&lt;a href="/theme/index.html"&gt;</span>Theme<span class="hljs-params">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
</code></pre><a class="anchor" id="repository-check"></a>
<h2>Repository Check</h2>
<p>We have spent time working with both Cloud9 and AWS Educate. I want to be sure you are able to use these resources.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pull your GitHub Pages repository on Cloud9 (c9.io)</li>
<li>Open up the <strong>theme/index.html</strong> file in the editor.</li>
<li>On the left, display the <strong>workspace</strong> sidebar and select <strong>theme/index.html</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket01.elvenware.com/images/prog109-midterm-c91.gif" alt="c9 Display"></p>
<p>In this image we see the <strong>workspace</strong> on the left and <strong>index.html</strong> from the theme directory in the editor. In the bash shell (command line) view at the bottom we have navigated to the theme directory.</p>
<p>Take a similar screenshot for your AWS Educate version of Cloud 9.</p>
<p>On your GitHub pages site, place both images in your images directory. Create a file called <strong>cloud9-images.html</strong> in the root of your repository. Display both images in it, much as I display one of the images in this document. Link to the page from the home page for your site, using <strong>Cloud9 Images</strong> as the content of your anchor tag.</p>
<p>Hopefully these instructions are clear. It might help you understand the instructions if you remember that the point of this section of the midterm is to show me that you are on both Cloud9 and AWS Educate and that you are able to clone and pull from your GitHub repository to those environments. I also want to check that you understand Cloud9 well enough to open up a specific file in the editor, and to display a particular portion of your workspace in the navigation pane on the left.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <em>If you are unable to get onto Cloud9 or AWS Educate for some reason, please tell me so when you submit the midterm. If you could not succeed, it will not completely ruin your midterm grade. It is, however, a part of this course to help you understand how to set up cloud services. We have dedicated significant class time to this subject, and given you plenty of time to set things up with AWS Educate and Cloud9. It is almost impossible for anyone to function in the modern web development world without using cloud services. Proving that you can sign up for them, and get them to work, is a significant part of this course and likely a significant part of your ability to function in the job market.</em></p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <em>One of the facts of life with cloud services is that they sometimes go down, and sometimes don&#39;t work exactly as advertised. Yet ultimately, all of the tools we are using (Windows, the Mac, Linux, Git, GitHub, GitHub Pages, C9, Visual Studio Code and AWS) will work. It&#39;s not enough just to tell me that some service or tool is broken. You have to learn to trouble shoot or workaround a problem. At one point during the quarter, GitHub Pages went down for about 24 hours. This was an extreme case, as most outages last much less time. Nevertheless, the problem occurred, and the only solution was to wait for Microsoft to fix the problem. Given that this is a possibility, you should not wait until the last minute to create your midterm. Get things close to your final state well ahead of the deadline, and then an outage will not completely block you. Yes, I would make an allowance for a last minute outage of that type in terms of our schedule, but still the point is valid: build in some time into your schedule for unexpected outages or other developments.</em></p>
<a class="anchor" id="display-on-ghp"></a>
<h2>Step Four: Display on GitHub Pages</h2>
<p>Provide links to your site Home Page and them Home Page.  When you submit the assignment, I&#39;ll want to see:</p>
<ul>
<li>A link to your Home Page for your site</li>
<li>A link to your Home page for your theme.</li>
</ul>
<a class="anchor" id="phone"></a>
<h2>Step Five: Phone</h2>
<p>To emulate your phone on Chrome:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Chrome</li>
<li>Bring up the Developer tools by<ul>
<li>Selecting either <strong>F12</strong> or <strong>Ctrl-Shift+I</strong></li>
<li>Or opening the Hamburger menu at top right (<strong>Alt+F</strong>) then <strong>More Tools | Developer Tools</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the developer choose toggle the Device Mode doohickey at the top left (<strong>Ctrl-Shift + M</strong>).</p>
<p>In the <strong>device</strong> drop down at the top left, you can optionally pick a particular device, such as <strong>Samsung Galaxy S4</strong> or <strong>Apple IPhone 6</strong> or something similar.</p>
<p>In the screen shot below, the doohickey and the <strong>device</strong> drop down are circled in red:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket01.elvenware.com/images/prog270-midterm-2016-02.png" alt="Device Mode Chrome"></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>I selected <strong>Samsung Galaxy S4</strong> in the <strong>device</strong> drop down. You can select any device, I just mention my selection so you can more easily find and identify the control I&#39;m talking about.</em></p>
<p>More details are provided on the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode/">Google Device Mode pages</a>.</p>
<a class="anchor" id="css-and-js-files"></a>
<h2>CSS and JS Files</h2>
<p>I&#39;m expecting to see CSS in, at minimum, a directory called <strong>Styles</strong> or <strong>styles</strong>, and in the <strong>ListButton</strong> directory. Many of you will also have CSS in your <strong>theme</strong> directory or in a sub-directory of your <strong>theme</strong> directory. You must style your pages.</p>
<p>I&#39;m also expecting to find JavaScript in the ListButton directory and I will check that it works.</p>
<a class="anchor" id="turn-it-in"></a>
<h2>Turn it in</h2>
<p>Make sure the HTML files for your completed site are in your repository. Since your GitHub pages site is based on your repository, this is a given, but still I mention it just to be complete.</p>
<p>When you turn in the assignment, provide a link to the home page of your running website. I&#39;m looking for a URL leading to your website running on GitHub pages. Since you need to turn in multipe links, the simplest approach will probably be to use the Text page of Canvas when submitting the assignment.</p>
<a class="anchor" id="network-page"></a>
<h2>Network Page</h2>
<p>You should turn frequently to the console and network pages in the Chrome and Firefox developer tools. Access them with F12 or Ctrl-Shift-I. Press F5 if necessary to refresh the display.</p>
<p>The images below are not from this course, but they show that files called <strong>first-style.css</strong>, <strong>style.css</strong>, <strong>googlecode.css</strong>, <strong>elven-help.js</strong> and the elvenware logo have all been loaded. If you see red on this page, you probably have a problem. (We have not yet worked with favicons, so I will give you a pass on that file.)</p>
