            This is wrong:
        </p>

        <pre>
    border: 2px black thick;
        </pre>

        <p>
            Do this:
        </p>

        <pre>
    border: 2px black solid;

        <h2>Image Rotation</h2>

        <p>
            If a number of your images are rotated the wrong way. I think this is because you were holding the camera at
            the wrong angle when you took the picture. To fix it: Add class called rotate to the your image:
        </p>

        <pre class="code"><code>
    &lt;figure class="rotate"&gt;
        &lt;img id="theme-washington" 
            src="../images/IMG_3933.jpg" 
            alt="Picture from Washington"&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
        </code></pre>

        <p>
            In your CSS define the class using the transform property:
        </p>

        <pre class="code"><code>
    figure.rotate {
        transform: rotate(0.25turn);
    }
    </code></pre>

    <p>Whether it is better to rotate the figure that wraps an image, or the image itself, is not clear to me. You might want to try both techniques and see which is best.</p>

    
    <figure>
        <img  id="blue-arrow" src="../images/200px-Arrow_Blue_Up_001.svg.png" alt="Blue arrow pointing up by default">
    </figure>

    
    <div>
        <div>
            <input type="radio" id="right" name="sorter" value="rotate-right" checked>
            <label for="right">Right</label>
    
            <input type="radio" id="left" name="sorter" value="rotate-left">
            <label for="left">Left</label>

            <input type="radio" id="top" name="sorter" value="rotate-top">
            <label for="top">Top</label>

            <input type="radio" id="down" name="sorter" value="rotate-down">
            <label for="down">Down</label>

            <div>
                <button id="rotateAction" type="button">Rotate</button>                
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform">Transform on MDN.</a></p> 

    <p>First select a <b>radio</b> button, then click the <b>rotate</b> button. Depending on which <b>radio</b> button is selected, a different style will be applied to the arrow. In other words, this code uses the technique outlined above, it is just that I defined multiple classes, like this:</p>

    <pre class="code scroll"><code>
    .rotate-top {
        transform: rotate(0.0turn);
    }

    .rotate-right {
        transform: rotate(0.25turn);
    }    
       
    .rotate-down {
        transform: rotate(0.5turn);
    }            

    .rotate-left {
        transform: rotate(0.75turn);
    }
    </code></pre>

    <p>I use JavaScript to apply the various classes to the image.</p>

            <h2>Float Image and Caption</h2>
    
            <p>
                Yes, I remember hitting this in class and leaving the matter unresolved. Here is what I would do now:
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Give the figure a class, let's call it float-right. In the css, give the rule for figure.float-right a
                declaration of float: right;. Since the figcaption and the img are in the figure, they should also be
                automatically floated to the right. This means you should be able to remove the float: right; declaration
                from the img.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Summary: float the figure rather than the img. The img and the figcaption are children of the figure so
                they come along for the ride.
            </p>

        <h2>Directory names: Images vs images</h2>

        <p>
            Some students have one or two directories for your images files with similar names distinguished by case:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>images</li>
            <li>Images</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The errors that you get with a mixup between <b>images</b> and <b>Images</b> can probably see that best on Cloud9 rather than on Windows. That is because Cloud9 is based on Linux and is case sensitive, while Windows is not.
        </p>

        <p>
            On Cloud9, copy the contents of Images to images. Then, on Cloud9, do this:
        </p>

        <pre>
    git rm -r Images
        </pre>

        <p>
            Don't try that command on Windows, though it might work. Do it on cloud9.
        </p>

        <p>
            Check all your links to images and make sure they point at the images directory, not at Images.
        </p>

        &lt;img src="../images/sammy.jpeg" alt="My dog Sammy"&gt;
