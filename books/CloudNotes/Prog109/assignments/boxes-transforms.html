        This is wrong:
    
    border: 2px black thick;
    
    Do this:
    
    border: 2px black solid;
    </section>

        <h2>Float Image and Caption</h2>

        <p>
            Yes, I remember hitting this in class and leaving the matter unresolved. Here is what I would do now:
        </p>

<p>
    Give the figure a class, let's call it float-right. In the css, give the rule for figure.float-right a declaration of float: right;. Since the figcaption and the img are in the figure, they should also be automatically floated to the right. This means you should be able to remove the float: right; declaration from the img.
</p>

<p>
    Summary: float the figure rather than the img. The img and the figcaption are children of the figure so they come along for the ride.

        A number of your images are rotated the wrong way. I think this is because you were holding the camera at the wrong angle when you took the picture. To fix it:

        Add class called rotate to the your image (Washington)
        
        <figure class="rotate">
        <img id="theme-washington" src="../images/IMG_3933.jpg" alt="Picture from Washington">
        </figure>
        
        In your CSS define the class using the transform property:
        
        figure.rotate {
        transform: rotate(0.25turn);
        }

        You have two directories for your images files:

        - images
        - Images
        
        You can probably see that best on Cloud9 rather than on Windows.
        
        On Cloud9, copy the contents of Images to images. Then, on Cloud9, do this:
        
        git rm -r Images
        
        Don't try that command on Windows, though it might work. Do it on cloud9.
        
        Check all your links to images and make sure they point at the images directory, not at Images.
