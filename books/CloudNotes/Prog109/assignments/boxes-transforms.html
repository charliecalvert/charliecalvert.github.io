            This is wrong:
        </p>

        <pre>
    border: 2px black thick;
        </pre>

        <p>
            Do this:
        </p>

        <pre>
    border: 2px black solid;
        </pre>

        <h2>Float Image and Caption</h2>

        <p>
            Yes, I remember hitting this in class and leaving the matter unresolved. Here is what I would do now:
        </p>

        <p>
            Give the figure a class, let's call it float-right. In the css, give the rule for figure.float-right a
            declaration of float: right;. Since the figcaption and the img are in the figure, they should also be
            automatically floated to the right. This means you should be able to remove the float: right; declaration
            from the img.
        </p>

        <p>
            Summary: float the figure rather than the img. The img and the figcaption are children of the figure so
            they come along for the ride.

    <section id="rotate">
        <h2>Image Rotation</h2>

        <p>
            If a number of your images are rotated the wrong way. I think this is because you were holding the camera at
            the wrong angle when you took the picture. To fix it: Add class called rotate to the your image:
        </p>

        <pre class="code"><code>
    &lt;figure class="rotate"&gt;
        &lt;img id="theme-washington" 
            src="../images/IMG_3933.jpg" 
            alt="Picture from Washington"&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
        </code></pre>

        <p>
            In your CSS define the class using the transform property:
        </p>

        <pre class="code"><code>
    figure.rotate {
        transform: rotate(0.25turn);
    }
    </code></pre>

            You have two directories for your images files:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>images</li>
            <li>Images</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            You can probably see that best on Cloud9 rather than on Windows.
        </p>

        <p>
            On Cloud9, copy the contents of Images to images. Then, on Cloud9, do this:
        </p>

        <pre>
    git rm -r Images
        </pre>

        <p>
            Don't try that command on Windows, though it might work. Do it on cloud9.
        </p>

        <p>
            Check all your links to images and make sure they point at the images directory, not at Images.
        </p>

        <pre class="code"><code>
        <img src="../images/sammy.jpeg" alt="My dog Sammy">
    </code></pre>
