            <p>We are going to learn more about JavaScript functions. Use the <b>ListButton</b> assignment to help you
                with portions of this assignment.</p>

            <h2>Get Started</h2>

            <p>Inside the <b>javascripts-tests</b> directory create <b>function-basics.html</b> and <b>function-basics.js</b>.
                Add a <b>script</b> statement to the <b>head</b> element of the HTML file that links in the JavaScript
                file. </p>
            <p>Create a link from your home page to <b>function-basics.html.</b></p>
            <p>In what follows, When I ask you to print something out, use console.log to print it.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a function called <b>simpleFunction</b> that prints out the phrase: "functions should
                    consist of statements designed to perform a single task."</li>
                <li>Create a function called <b>functionParameters</b> that takes a single parameter and prints it out.</li>
                <li>Create a function called <b>functionReturn</b> that returns the string "Many functions return
                    values."</li>
            </ul>

            <p>At the bottom of <b>function-basics.js</b> call all three functions. Pass the following string to <b>functionParameters</b>:
                "Many functions take parameters."</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Show Results in Html</h2>
            <p>In <b>function-basics.html</b> create an H1 element with the content <b>Function Basics</b>.</p>
            <p>Add three empty paragraph elements. Give them the following IDs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>simple-function</li>
                <li>function-parameters</li>
                <li>function-return</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Add a button with the content <b>Call Functions</b> and the ID set to <b>function-calls</b></p>

            <p>In <b>function-basics.js</b>, inside an <b>window.onload</b> method, respond to clicks on the button by
                calling all three functions and displaying the output in the appropriate paragraph element.</p>

            <p>Here are some hints. First, be sure all your code is inside the <b>window.onload</b> method:</p>

            <pre class="code">
                <code>
window.onload = {
    // All code goes in here.
}
                </code>
            </pre>

    <p>
        First find the elements on the page that we are going to need to access. This is often the first step in this kind of code.
    </p>

    <pre class="code"><code>
const simpleFunction = document.getElementById('simple-function');
const functionCalls = document.getElementById('function-calls');
    </code></pre>
    
    <p>Declare your simple function, accessing the <b>textContent</b> or alternatively <b>innerHTML</b> property of the paragraph. This will set the content of the P element.</p>

    <pre class="code"><code>
    function simple() {
        console.log('simple');
        simpleFunction.textContent = "simple";
    }
    </code></pre>

    <p><b>NOTE</b>: <i>We have a slight preference for <b>textContent</b> over <b>innerHTML</b> as it is faster and a bit safer. But if you want to insert HTML into an element rather than plain text, then use <b>innerHTML</b>.</i></p>
   
    <p>Finally, tell the button to call our function when it is clicked</p>
    <pre class="code"><code>
    functionCalls.onclick = simple;
</code></pre>
            <p>Note that we will need to modify the other functions so that, in addition to the console.log statements, they also set the <b>textContent</b> of
                each paragraph in <b>function-basics.html</b>.</p>
                
            <p> Note also that we don't call a function when we assign it to <b>onclick</b>. In other words, we write this: <b>onclick = simple</b> not <b>onclick = simple()</b>. The latter has side effects that you probably don't want in that it executes the <b>simple</b> function at the time of the assignment, rather than when the button is clicked.</p>

            <h2>Turn it in</h2>

            <p>Push your repository. When you submit your assignment, tell the me the folder and file names you have
                used. (The folder and file names should be as specified above, some students, however, turn in work
                with alternate names, which is not a good idea. The problem is only worse if they don't tell me the
                alternate names for their files that contain their work.</p>
