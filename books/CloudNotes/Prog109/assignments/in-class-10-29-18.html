            <h1>Today in Class: 10-29-18</h1>
        </header>
        <p>As we discuss various issues today in class, we will be creating a files called <strong>week07-day01.js</strong> and <strong>week07-day01.html</strong>. This file should be placed in the javascript-tests directory of your repository and pushed to GitHub.</p>

        <p><b>NOTE</b>: <i>You probably already have a directory called <b>JavaScriptTest</b> or <b>JavaScriptTests</b>. I want us to switch to having directories and files composed solely of lower case letters. To rename <b>JavaScriptTest</b> to javascript-tests do this:</i></p>

        <pre class="code"><code>
    git mv JavaScriptTest javascript-tests
        </code></pre>

        <p>When grading this assignment, I will check for the existence of this file and any related files, such as a CSS file, if we create or use one. I'm not looking for specific content in this file, nor am I at all likely to check the file for correctness. I just want to see that the file exists, and that it contains content at least reasonably in accord with what we are doing in class.</p>

        <p>I will also be looking at the history of your repository. In particular, I will run the command <strong>git log</strong>. This will show me how many times you pushed to GitHub this week. I'm expecting to see that you pushed several times today, and hopefully also that you will have pushed several more times throughout the week. Regardless, I expect to see that you pushed to GitHub at least 5 times this week.</p>

        <p>This assignment has three goals:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>To learn about or to learn more about JavaScript
                <ul>
                    <li>Variables (declarations)</li>
                    <li>for-loops (looping)</li>
                    <li>if statements (branching)</li>
                    <li>ES5 and ES6</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>To check that you are paying attention and following along in class.</li>
            <li>To check that you are using your repository.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>A somewhat unintended consequence is that this is also a means of my taking role. If you missed class for some reason, please explain why when you submit the assignment. As explained elsewhere, I will almost always "forgive" a student for missing one class per quarter, which means -- I suppose -- showing mercy when grading this assignment if you missed class. But if you miss multiple classes, I will be looking for a good explanation before letting up on the grading of this assignment.</p>
