            <h2>Basics</h2>

            <p>Our goal is to learn about JavaScript arrays. Use the <b>Object Choices</b>, <b>ListButton</b> and <b>Function Basics</b> assignments to help you with portions of this assignment. Use the first link below to go to Elvenware and read at least the openning sections on JavaScript Arrays.</p>

            Above you can see a possible UI for the application as it appears after selecting the <b>language names</b> buttons.
            
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Get Started</h2>

            <p>Inside the <b>javascripts-tests</b> directory create <b>javascript-arrays.html</b> and <b>javascript-arrays.js</b>. Add a <b>script</b> statement to the <b>head</b> element of the HTML file that links in the JavaScript file. Create a link from your home page to <b>javascript-arrays.html</b>. Also link in your standard <b>styles.css</b> file and your <b>elf-buttons.css</b> stylesheet.</p>

            <p>In what follows, when I ask you to print something out, use <b>console.log</b> to print it. Our primary goal, however, will be to display our results on our HTML page. When declaring methods, use ES6 (fat arrow) syntax throughout.</p>

            <p><b>NOTE</b>: <i>Our goal is to use <b>console.log</b> and node js to quickly display the output of our JavaScript functions on the command line while we are developing our code. Once we have our code working, then we switch to displaying the output on our HTML page. This is just an effort to simplify the development process, if you find it cumbersome, you can try other techniques.</i></p>

            <p><b>HINT</b>: <i>This is optional. If you have used <b>File | Open Folder</b> in Visual Studio Code, then you can open a JavaScript file and choose <b>Debug | Start Debugging</b> to set break points and step through your JavaScript code inside the VS Code IDE.</i></p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Working with Numbers</h2>

            <p>Create an empty object literal called <b>arrays</b>. (Recall that we use curly braces to create an object literal.) In it, declare a property called <b>numbers</b> of type array with content ranging ranging from 15 to 5: <b>[15, 14...]</b> (Recall that previously we declared properties of an object literal called <b>firstName</b> and <b>lastName</b>. What we are doing here is similar, though this time the type is not a string but an array of integers.)</p>
                
            <p>At the bottom of the file, write a simple <b>for..of</b> loop that display the members of the array. This confirms our array is declared correctly and that we know how to loop over the elements of the array.</p>
                

            <h2>Display with HTML</h2>

            <p>
                Once you are sure you have the code working:
            </p>
                
            <ul>
                <li>select the <b>for..of</b> loop</p></li>
                <li>Cut the loop to the clipboard</li>
                <li>Use ES6 syntax to create a <b>window.onload</b> event handler at the top of the JavaScript file.</li>
                <li>Paste the loop into the event handler</li>
            </ul>

            <p>At this stage, we are ready to begin displaying the code in our HTML file.</p>

            <p>In the HTML file set up our basic structure:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>header</li>
                <li>nav</li>
                <li>main</li>
                <li>footer</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In the <b>main</b> section:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create an empty unordered list with an ID of <b>numbers-display</b>.</li>
                <li>Create a button with an ID of <b>numbers-action</b> and labelled <b>Sbow Numbers</b></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Back in the JavaScript file, use <b>getElementById</b> to get a handle to our button and our <b>numbers-display</b> list and then, on the button click event:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Show the numbers in the HTML page</li>
                <li>Sort the list of numbers</li>
                <li>Display them again in the HTML page.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The details on how to do this are outlined below. For now, just grasp what needs to be done.</p>
            
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>List of Languages</h2>

            <p>Do the same as above, but this time use a list of computer programming and markup languages, and display the list only once on the HTML page. Here are the languages:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>C#</li>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>C/C++</li>
            </ul>

            <p>List them in the array in the order shown above. But when you display them, show them in alphabetical order.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Array of Objects</h2>
            
            <p>This is similar to the previous two exercises, but this time I want an <a href="https://www.elvenware.com/charlie/development/web/JavaScript/JavaScriptBasics.html#array-of-objects">array of JavaScript object literals.</a>.</p>

            <p>Go to each of the following sites, and get the top seven languages and list their names and their ranking. For instance, here is what one of the objects in your array of objects might look like:</p>

            <pre class="code">
                <code>
    {
        language: 'JavaScript',
        rank: 1
    }
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>Here is where to look for the rankings</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://hackernoon.com/top-3-most-popular-programming-languages-in-2018-and-their-annual-salaries-51b4a7354e06">Hacker Noon, languages and salaries</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">TIOBE</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html">PYPL</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://octoverse.github.com/projects#languages">GitHub</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#technology">Stack Overflow</a></li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Show Results in Html</h2>
            <p>In <b>javascript-arrays.html</b> create an H1 element with the content <b>Object Choices</b>.</p>
            <p>Add three empty paragraph elements. Give them the following IDs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>numbers-display</li>
                <li>tech-language-names-display</li>
                <li>tech-language-popularity-display</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Add three buttons. Give them the labels <b>Simple Object</b> <b>Function Object</b> and <b>Custom Class</b>. Set the IDs of the buttons to: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>numbers-action</li>
                <li>tech-language-names-action</li>
                <li>tech-language-popularity-action</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In <b>javascript-arrays.js</b>, inside an <b>window.onload</b> method, respond to clicks on the button by all three arrays and their methods and displaying the output in the appropriate paragraph element.</p>

            <pre class="code"><code>
    window.onload = () => {
        const arrays = {
            numbers: [15, 14, 13, ...],
            languageNames: ...,
            languagePopularity: ...
        };
        
        const numbersAction = document...
        const languageNamesAction = ...
        const techLanguagePopularityAction = ...
    
        numbersAction.onclick = () => {
            const numbersDisplay = document...;
            for (let number of arrays.numbers) {
                const li = document.createElement("li");
                li.appendChild(document.createTextNode(number));
                numbersDisplay.appendChild(li);
            }    
        };
        languageNamesAction.onclick = () => {};
        techLanguagePopularityAction.onclick = () => {};
    };                    
            </code></pre>

            <p>
                In the above, the details are missing, but you can see the basic structure of the onload event handler. The new code is in the <b>for...of</b> loop. In the code we:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Use document.createElement to create a new list item. We are using JavaScript to do the same thing we do in HTML when we write &&&&&lt;li&gt;. We are dynamically creating an HTML element in JavaScript code.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Recall that the <a href="function-basics.html">Function Basics</a> assignment contains hints on how to perform these tasks.</p>    

            <p>In particular, remember that we will need to modify the existing methods so that set the items in each list in <b>javascript-arrays.html</b>. Beneath the H1 element add a paragraph that explains, in your own words, what is happening on the page. In particular, explain what the buttons do. This need not be a detailed explanation, but cover the key points. You might start like this: "When you click the button an event is fired that..." </p>
                

        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Styles</h2>

            <p>Style your buttons as you did in the <b>List Button</b> assignment. Also style your paragraph elements to use a 20 point or larger font, and perhaps use a cursive font. Add any other custom styling to the page that you want, but be sure all the styles you use are custom written by hand. Do not block copy CSS from some other project you find on the web, and do not use CSS properties that we have not discussed in class. (Okay, I might take a maximum one or two other properties, but only if you explain how they work in the paragraph you added at top of the HTML page.) In other words, I don't want you pasting in CSS that you don't completely understand, and I want you to stick exclusively, or almost exclusively, to the CSS properties we have discussed in class.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Turn it in</h2>

            <p>Push your repository. When you submit your assignment, tell the me the folder and file names you have used. (The folder and file names should, of course, be as specified above. If you have, however, gone off the res, then let me know.) You <b>must</b> provide a link to your page running on GitHub Pages. It's okay to include a link to your repository, in fact, I want you to do that. But also be sure to include a clickable link to your running pages. Use the Canvas Text page to provide these links. I'll kick back any assignments that don't include a link.</p>
