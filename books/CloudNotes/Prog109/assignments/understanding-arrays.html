            <h2>Basics</h2>

            <p>Our goal is to learn about JavaScript arrays. Use the <b>Object Choices</b>, <b>ListButton</b> and <b>Function
                    Basics</b> assignments to help you with portions of this assignment. Use the first link below to go
                to Elvenware and read at least the openning sections on JavaScript Arrays.</p>

            Above you can see a possible UI for the application as it appears after selecting the <b>language names</b>
            buttons.

        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Get Started</h2>

            <p>Inside the <b>javascripts-tests</b> directory create <b>javascript-arrays.html</b> and <b>javascript-arrays.js</b>.
                Add a <b>script</b> statement to the <b>head</b> element of the HTML file that links in the JavaScript
                file. Create a link from your home page to <b>javascript-arrays.html</b>. Also link in your standard <b>styles.css</b>
                file and your <b>elf-buttons.css</b> stylesheet.</p>

            <p>In what follows, when I ask you to print something out, use <b>console.log</b> to print it. Our primary
                goal, however, will be to display our results on our HTML page. When declaring methods, use ES6 (fat
                arrow) syntax throughout.</p>

            <p><b>NOTE</b>: <i>Our goal is to use <b>console.log</b> and node js to quickly display the output of our
                    JavaScript functions on the command line while we are developing our code. Once we have our code
                    working, then we switch to displaying the output on our HTML page. This is just an effort to
                    simplify the development process, if you find it cumbersome, you can try other techniques.</i></p>

            <p><b>HINT</b>: <i>This is optional. If you have used <b>File | Open Folder</b> in Visual Studio Code, then
                    you can open a JavaScript file and choose <b>Debug | Start Debugging</b> to set break points and
                    step through your JavaScript code inside the VS Code IDE.</i></p>

            <p><b>HINT</b>: <i>In the following, we will create three buttons and three lists, putting the results for
                    each button click in its own list.</i></p>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Working with Numbers</h2>

            <p>Create an empty object literal called <b>arrays</b>. (Recall that we use curly braces to create an
                object literal.) In it, declare a property called <b>numbers</b> of type array with content ranging
                ranging from 15 to 5: <b>[15, 14...]</b> (Recall that previously we declared properties of an object
                literal called <b>firstName</b> and <b>lastName</b>. What we are doing here is similar, though this
                time the type is not a string but an array of integers.)</p>

            <p>At the bottom of the file, write a simple <b>for..of</b> loop that display the members of the array.
                This confirms our array is declared correctly and that we know how to loop over the elements of the
                array.</p>


            <h2>Display with HTML</h2>

            <p>
                Once you are sure you have the code working:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>select the <b>for..of</b> loop</p>
                </li>
                <li>Cut the loop to the clipboard</li>
                <li>Use ES6 syntax to create a <b>window.onload</b> event handler at the top of the JavaScript file.</li>
                <li>Paste the loop into the event handler</li>
            </ul>

            <p>At this stage, we are ready to begin displaying the code in our HTML file.</p>

            <p>In the HTML file set up our basic structure:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>header</li>
                <li>nav</li>
                <li>main</li>
                <li>footer</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In the <b>main</b> section create the first of your three pairs of buttons and lists:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create an empty unordered list with an ID of <b>numbers-display</b>.</li>
                <li>Create a button with an ID of <b>numbers-action</b> and labelled <b>Sbow Numbers</b></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Back in the JavaScript file, use <b>getElementById</b> to get a handle to our button and our <b>numbers-display</b>
                list and then, on the button click event:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Show the numbers in the HTML page</li>
                <li>Sort the list of numbers</li>
                <li>Display them again in the HTML page.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The details on how to do this are outlined below. For now, just grasp what needs to be done.</p>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>List of Languages</h2>

            <p>Do the same as above, but this time use a list of computer programming and markup languages, and display
                the list only once on the HTML page. Here are the languages:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>C#</li>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>C/C++</li>
            </ul>

            <p>List them in the array in the order shown above.</p>

            <p>Create a second button and list pair. Display the list of languages in alphabetical order.</p>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Array of Objects</h2>

            <p>This extra credit exercises is similar to the previous two exercises, but this time I want an <a href="https://www.elvenware.com/charlie/development/web/JavaScript/JavaScriptBasics.html#array-of-objects">array
                    of JavaScript object literals.</a>. Again, we will have a button and perhaps some nested lists.</p>

            <p>Go to each of the following sites, and get the top seven languages and list their names and their
                ranking. For instance, here is what one of the objects in your array of objects might look like:</p>

            <pre class="code">
                <code>
    {
        language: 'JavaScript',
        rank: 1
    }
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>Here is where to look for the rankings</p>
            <ul>

            <h2>Show Results in Html</h2>

            <p>This is an overview of the structure of the project. In this section I provide some details on how to
                implement some of the key parts of the project.</p>

            <p>In <b>javascript-arrays.html</b> create an H1 element with the content <b>Object Choices</b>.</p>
            <p>Add three empty paragraph elements. Give them the following IDs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>numbers-display</li>
                <li>tech-language-names-display</li>
                <li>tech-language-popularity-display</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Add three buttons. Give them the labels <b>Simple Object</b> <b>Function Object</b> and <b>Custom Class</b>.
                Set the IDs of the buttons to: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>numbers-action</li>
                <li>tech-language-names-action</li>
                <li>tech-language-popularity-action</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In <b>javascript-arrays.js</b>, inside an <b>window.onload</b> method, respond to clicks on the button
                by all three arrays and their methods and displaying the output in the appropriate paragraph element.</p>

            <pre class="code"><code>
    window.onload = () => {
        const arrays = {
            numbers: [15, 14, 13, ...],
            languageNames: ...,
            languagePopularity: ...
        };
        
        const numbersAction = document...
        const languageNamesAction = ...
        const techLanguagePopularityAction = ...
    
        numbersAction.onclick = () => {
            const numbersDisplay = document...;
            for (let number of arrays.numbers) {
                const li = document.createElement("li");
                li.appendChild(document.createTextNode(number));
                numbersDisplay.appendChild(li);
            }    
        };
        languageNamesAction.onclick = () => {};
        techLanguagePopularityAction.onclick = () => {};
    };                    
            </code></pre>

            <p>
                In the above, the details are missing, but you can see the basic structure of the onload event handler.
                
            </p>

            <h2 id="add-list-items">Adding List Items to an Unordered List</h2>

            <p>The code we care about most in the excerpt found in the previous section is in the <b>for...of</b> loop. In that code we:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Use <b>document.createElement</b> to create a new list item. We are using JavaScript to do the same thing
                    we do in HTML when we write <b>&lt;li&gt;</b>. We are dynamically creating an HTML element in JavaScript
                    code. After the line executes, we have an empty list item:
                    <ul>
                        <li>&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The next line uses <b>document.createTextNode</b> to create a text object that can be appended onto a
                    list item. This is similar to what we do when we write <b>foo.textContent = '...'</b> in our <b>Object Choices</b> propgram. But this time,
                    instead of assigning a value to the <b>textContent</b> property of a paragraph, we are creating a
                    <b>textNode</b> that contains the text we want to display, and inserting (appending) it to the list
                    item. Now we have a list item with some text in it:
                    <ul>
                        <li>&lt;li&gt;My Text&lt;/li&gt;</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Finally, in the last line, we write <b>numbersDisplay.appendChild(li)</b> and append the list item to the list on our HTML page.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket01.elvenware.com/images/understanding-arrays-object.png" alt="Display a list item in a list and show displaying an object." class="normal-image"></p>

            <p>In this screenshot shown above, we create three list items using the technique we just outlined. We display each list in an unordered list.</p>

            <p>In creating the text for the list items, I iterated over the array of objects. Each object had two properties called <b>language</b> and <b>rank</b>, just as each object in a previous exercise had two properties called <b>firstName</b> and <b>lastName</b>. I then combined the two properties into a single line, just as did in the <b>fullName</b> method from the previous assignment.</p>

            <p>In this exercise, we display the items in each array in a unordered list (UL). The list is displayed in <b>javascript-arrays.html</b>. Beneath the H2 element on your page add a paragraph that explains, in your own words, what is happening on the page. In particular, explain what the buttons do. This need not be a detailed explanation such as the one I give above, but cover one or two of the key points. You might start like this: "When you click the button an event is fired that..." </p>


        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Styles</h2>

            <p>Style your buttons as you did in the <b>List Button</b> assignment. Also style your paragraph elements
                to use a 20 point or larger font, and perhaps use a cursive font. Add any other custom styling to the
                page that you want, but be sure all the styles you use are custom written by hand. Do not block copy
                CSS from some other project you find on the web, and do not use CSS properties that we have not
                discussed in class. (Okay, I might take a maximum one or two other properties, but only if you explain
                how they work in the paragraph you added at top of the HTML page.) In other words, I don't want you
                pasting in CSS that you don't completely understand, and I want you to stick exclusively, or almost
                exclusively, to the CSS properties we have discussed in class.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Turn it in</h2>

            <p>Push your repository. When you submit your assignment, tell the me the folder and file names you have
                used. (The folder and file names should, of course, be as specified above. If you have, however, gone
                off the res, then let me know.) You <b>must</b> provide a link to your page running on GitHub Pages.
                It's okay to include a link to your repository, in fact, I want you to do that. But also be sure to
                include a clickable link to your running pages. Use the Canvas Text page to provide these links. I'll
                kick back any assignments that don't include a link.</p>
