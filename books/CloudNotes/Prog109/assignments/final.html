            <p>This document lists the features I'm looking for in the Prog 109 2018 final. Please note that I'm not expecting everyone to get everything right. Instead, do the best you can. It is much better to turn in an imperfect final than it is to turn in nothing. I tend to be a generous grader, and students who have come regularly to class and turned in all the assignments are very likely to pass the course,perhaps even with a better than expected grade. If, however, you don't turn in the final, you will be at considerable risk since the final is one third of your grade.</p>

            <p>The primary goal will be to show me that you understand the two areas we have focused on:</p>
        
            <ol>
                <li>HTML and CSS</li>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
            </ol>

            <p>In particular, I will to see that you:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Can complete most of the homework assignments.</li>
                <li>Can polish your midterm theme and one or two features to it.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Another way to think about your overall goal for the final is that you want to turn in code that <i>just works</i>. The links in Canvas to your GitHub Pages should just work. The links in your program should <i>just work</i>. The assignments we have worked on should <i>just work</i>.</p>

            <p>This will be a take home final, due on middle or later half of the week of Dec 2, 2018. I'll have a more precise date late, but the 5th would be a reasonable approximation for you to work with for now. I strongly suggest that you begin working on the final Nov 28th, and do a bit more work each day until it is due.</p>

            <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
        
            <p>Here are list of features I will look for:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Links to your site and theme home page.</li>
                <li>A site home page (index.html) in the root of your repository that contains links to all your homework and your theme.</li>
                <li>A theme home page in the root of your theme that points to all the pages of your theme. </li>
                <li>A <b>favicon.ico file in the root of your repository.</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This subject addressed further down in this document.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>An alternative CSS file that can be activated by a button click.
                    <ul>
                        <li>This should appear on three pages: your home for your site and theme, and on your about page.</li>
                        <li>The details of how to implement this are covered below.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Do the best you can to get your site to work on a mobile device such as your phone.</li>
                <li>Polish, polish, polish. You now have a chance to revisit your theme, and should be able to fix problems I pointed out when grading it, and also add new features.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your code for all pages should pass HTML Validate</li>                        
                        <li>All your links should work</li>
                        <li>There should be no errors in the console page of the developer tools.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Perhaps we will be lucky, but I'm expecting quite a few students to turn in pages with errors on them. However, it you can get your site to render entirely error free, and still meet a good percentage of the requirements, then you can expect to be in very good shape. But if you do have errors, don't despair. Just do the best you can and turn in the assignment on time if at all possible.</p>

            <h2>Favorite Icon</h2>

            <p>I don't know how I've managed to get this far in the course without broaching this topic. It is, however, a simple one, and it adds considerable polish to your site.</p>

        <section>

            <h2>Alternative stylesheets</h2>

            <p>Don't name a variable <b>default</b>. It is a reserved word. A simple workaround would be to called <b>defaults</b>:</p>

        <pre class="code scroll"><code>
                const defaults = document...
