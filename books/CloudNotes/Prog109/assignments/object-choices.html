            <h2>Simple Objects</h2>

            <p>Our goal is to learn about JavaScript objects. Use the <b>ListButton</b> and <b>Function Basics</b>
                assignments to help you with portions of this assignment. Use the links below to go to Elvenware and
                read at least the openning sections of JavaScript Objects and review the section on JavaScript function
                types.</p>

            <h2>Get Started</h2>

            <p>Inside the <b>javascripts-tests</b> directory create <b>object-choices.html</b> and <b>object-choices.js</b>.
                Add a <b>script</b> statement to the <b>head</b> element of the HTML file that links in the JavaScript
                file. Create a link from your home page to <b>object-choices.html</b>.</p>

            <p>In what follows, when I ask you to print something out, use <b>console.log</b> to print it. When I ask
                you to call a method, put the calls beneath all the object or class declarations. In other words, the
                bottom of the file should consist only of method calls, and the top portions of the file should contain
                your object and class declarations or implementations. When declaring methods, use ES6 (fat arrow)
                syntax throughout.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Key Steps</h2>

            <p>Create three objects, each with at least one method. Call the methods. Where necessary, first
                instantiate the object with <b>new</b>.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Create an object literal called <b>simpleObject</b>. In it create a method called <b>sayName</b>
                    that prints out the phrase: "Simple Object." Call the method.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Outside the object declaration, use dot notation to add another method called <b>dynamicMethod</b>.
                            It should print out its own name: "Dynamic Method". At the bottom of the file, call the
                            method.</li>
                        <li>Here's a hint. The declaration for the method declared outside the object declaration will
                            look something like <b>ObjectName.methodName = &lt;Implement an anonymous function
                                here.&gt;</b>.)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><i>Do the best you can with this one. I will grade it lightly. </i>Create a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/constructor">constructor
                        function</a> called <b>FunctionObject</b> that contains a method called <b>sayName</b> that is
                    declared on the <b>prototype</b> of the <b>FunctionObject</b>. At the bottom of the file,
                    instantiate the object with <b>new</b> and call the method. (When I say constructor function, this
                    does not mean we use the key word constructor. It just means the funciton begins with a capital
                    letter to signal to the user to instantiate the function object with new.)
                    <ul>
                        <li>Add a private function called <b>privateFunction</b> and call it from <b>sayName</b>. The
                            private function should print out the string <b>"Private Function"</b></li>
                        <li>Optionally print out the constructor. For instance, if your instance of <b>FunctionObject</b>
                            is called <b>functionObject</b> then write <b>console.log(functionObject.constructor.toString())</b>.
                            The point of this exercise is to show that a constructor is being created, and in fact your
                            method is that constructor. But we don't explicitly use the word constructor when we create
                            it.</li>
                        <li>Optionally create a dynamic method outside the object declaration. You will need to use <b>prototype</b>
                            to make this work.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li id="custom-class">For extra credit, create a class called <b>Custom Class</b> with a method called
                    <b>sayName</b> that returns the string <b>Custom Class</b>. At the bottom of the file instantiate
                    the method and call the method. On Elvenware there are <a href="https://www.elvenware.com/charlie/development/web/JavaScript/JavaScriptObjects.html#class-basics">with
                        some very broad hints</a> on how to work with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes">JavaScript
                        classes</a>. Also there is <a href="https://javascript.info/class">an example on
                        JavaScript.info</a></li>
            </ol>

            <p>As explained above, at the bottom of <b>object-choices.js</b> I want you to call the methods of all
                three objects. </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Show Results in Html</h2>
            <p>In <b>object-choices.html</b> create an H1 element with the content <b>Object Choices</b>.</p>
            <p>Add three empty paragraph elements. Give them the following IDs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>simple-object-display</li>
                <li>function-object-display</li>
                <li>custom-class-display</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Add three buttons. Give them the labels <b>Simple Object</b> <b>Function Object</b> and <b>Custom Class</b>.
                Set the IDs of the buttons to: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>simple-object-action</li>
                <li>function-object-action</li>
                <li>custom-class-action</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In <b>object-choices.js</b>, inside an <b>window.onload</b> method, respond to clicks on the button by
                calling all three objects and their methods and displaying the output in the appropriate paragraph
                element.</p>

            <p><img class="normal-image" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket01.elvenware.com/images/object-choices-onload.png"
                    alt="onload method with three onclick handlers"></p>

            <p>
                In this image I have used code folding to hide the implementation of my three onclick handlers.
                Nevertheless, you can see the basic structure of the onload event handler.
            </p>

            <p>Recall that the <a href="function-basics.html">Function Basics</a> assignment contains hints on how to
                perform these tasks.</p>

            <p>In particular, remember that we will need to modify the existing methods so that, in addition to the <b>console.log</b>
                statements, they also set the <b>textContent</b> of
                each paragraph in <b>object-choices.html</b>. Beneath the H1 element add a paragraph that explains, in
                your own words, what is happening on the page. In particular, explain what the buttons do. This need
                not be a detailed explanation, but cover the key points. You might start like this: "When you click the
                button an event is fired that..." </p>

            <p><img class="normal-image" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket01.elvenware.com/images/object-choices-objects.png"
                    alt="The implmentation of the objects"></p>

            <p>Again note that I have used the VS Code tools to fold my implementation of the two objects and one
                class. My goal was to show you the structure of the code without showing you exactly how I implemented
                it. That part is up to you.</p>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Styles</h2>

            <p>Style your buttons as you did in the <b>List Button</b> assignment. Also style your paragraph elements
                to use a 20 point or larger font, and perhaps use a cursive font. Add any other custom styling to the
                page that you want, but be sure all the styles you use are custom written by hand. Do not block copy
                CSS from some other project you find on the web, and do not use CSS properties that we have not
                discussed in class. (Okay, I might take a maximum one or two other properties, but only if you explain
                how they work in the paragraph you added at top of the HTML page.) In other words, I don't want you
                pasting in CSS that you don't completely understand, and I want you to stick exclusively, or almost
                exclusively, to the CSS properties we have discussed in class.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Turn it in</h2>

            <p>Push your repository. When you submit your assignment, tell the me the folder and file names you have
                used. (The folder and file names should, of course, be as specified above. If you have, however, gone
                off the res, then let me know.) You <b>must</b> provide a link to your page running on GitHub Pages.
                It's okay to include a link to your repository, in fact, I want you to do that. But also be sure to
                include a clickable link to your running pages. Use the Canvas Text page to provide these links.</p>
