            <h2>Simple Objects</h2>

            <p>Our goal is to learn about JavaScript objects. Use the <b>ListButton</b> and <b>Functio0n Choices</b> assignments to help you with portions of this assignment. Also read at least the open sections of JavaScript objects and review the section on JavaScript function types.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.elvenware.com/teach/assignments/Browser/ListButton.html">List Button</a></li>
                <li><a href="./function-basics.html">Function Choices</a></li>

            </ul>
            
            <p>Inside the <b>javascripts-tests</b> directory create <b>object-choices.html</b> and <b>object-choices.js</b>. Add a <b>script</b> statement to the <b>head</b> element of the HTML file that links in the JavaScript file.</p>

            <p>Create a link from your home page to <b>object-choices.html</b>.</p>

            <p>In what follows, When I ask you to print something out, use <b>console.log</b> to print it. When I ask you to call a method, put the calls beneath all the object or class declarations. In other words, the bottom of the file should consist only of method calls, and the top portions of the file should be contain your object and class declarations or implementations. When declaring our methods, use ES6 (fat arrow) syntax throughout.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Create an object literal called <b>simpleObject</b>. In it create a method called <b>sayName</b> that prints out the phrase: "Simple Object." Call the method.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Outside the object declaration, add another method called <b>dynamicMethod</b>. It should print out its own name: <b>Dynamic Method</b>. At the bottom of the file, call the method.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Create a constructor function object called <b>FunctionObject</b> that contains a method called <b>sayName</b> that is declared on the <b>prototype</b> of the <b>FunctionObject</b>. At the bottom of the file, instantiate the object with <b>new</b> and call the method.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Add a private function called <b>privateFunction</b> and call it from <b>sayName</b>. The private function should print out the string <b>Private Function</b></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Create a class called <b>Custom Class</b> that returns the string <b>Custom Class</b>. At the bottom of the file instantiate the method and call the method.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>As explained above, at the bottom of <b>object-choices.js</b> I want you to call the methods of all three objects. </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Show Results in Html</h2>
            <p>In <b>object-choices.html</b> create an H1 element with the content <b>Object Choices</b>.</p>
            <p>Add three empty paragraph elements. Give them the following IDs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>simple-object-display</li>
                <li>function-object-display</li>
                <li>custom-class-display</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Add three buttons. Give them the labels <b>Simple Object</b> <b>Function Object</b> and <b>Custom Class</b>. Set the IDs of the buttons to: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>simple-object-action</li>
                <li>function-object-action</li>
                <li>custom-class-action</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In <b>object-choices.js</b>, inside an <b>window.onload</b> method, respond to clicks on the button by
                calling all three objects and there methods and displaying the output in the appropriate paragraph element.</p>

            <p>Recall that the <a href="function-basics.html">Function Basics</a> assignment contains hints on how to perform these tasks.</p>    

            <p>In particular, remember that we will need to modify the existing methods so that, in addition to the <b>console.log</b> statements, they also set the <b>innerHtml</b> of
                each paragraph in <b>function-choices.html</b></p>
        </section>

            <h2>Turn it in</h2>

            <p>Push your repository. When you submit your assignment, tell the me the folder and file names you have used. (The folder and file names should, of course, be as specified above. If you have, however, gone off the res, then let me know.</p>
