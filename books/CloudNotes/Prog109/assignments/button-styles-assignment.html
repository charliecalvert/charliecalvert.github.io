            <h1>Style Button Elements</h1>

            <p>This assignment is based on the work you did in the <a href="https://www.elvenware.com/teach/assignments/Browser/ListButton.html" target="_blank">ListButton Assignment.</a></p>
            <ul>
                <li>In the <b>ListButton</b> directory create a style sheet called <b>styles.css</b>.</li>
                <li>Place code for styling buttons in it.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The deck in the References section provides a sample CSS rule for the <b>button</b> element. Model your work on it, but change the values of each property to suit your tastes. Don't use the same values as I do.</li>                        
                        <li>Your rule should have exactly five declarations in it. Don't add any other declarations or properties at this point.</li>
                        <li>The declaration property names should be the same as those in the Button Styles deck.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Link your style sheet into <b>ListButton/index.html</b></li>
                <li>When you are done, the buttons in the <b>ListButton</b> assignment should be uniquely styled with your styles. They should look different from they did before you added the style sheet.</li>                
            </ul>

            <h2>Reference</h2>

            <h2>Turn it in</h2>

            <p>Push your work to GitHub. Provide links to both your GitHub repository and your newly styled ListButton assignment running on GitHub Pages.</p>

            <p><b>NOTE</b>: <i>It is usually simplest to use the text page in Canvas to turn in assignments of this type. On that page you can past in hyperlinks. When I open your assignment I can click on the links and be taken directly to your repository and your assignment.</i></p>
