            <h1>Download and Load Local Images</h1>

            <p>This assignment describes how to work with images that you have stored directly on your website.</p>

            <p>We have been linking to images stored on remote sites such as the <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikimedia
                    Commons</a>. Quite often, however, the files you want to display will not be remote, but instead
                will be stored directly on your website.</p>
        </section>

            <h1>Local Files</h1>

            <p>Most of the files we use are stored directly on our website. For instance, our <b>index.html</b> and <b>styles.css</b>
                are local files stored directly on our website. Example of remote files would be the images on the
                Wikimedia Commons that we link to in our <b>img</b> elements</p>

            <p>Let's take a moment to review how we get local files to our website. When working with GitHub pages, we
                place files on our local website by following these steps:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>We copy the file to our local repository or we create the file directly inside our repository.</li>
                <li>We push the repository to the cloud. That is, we push it to GitHub.</li>
                <li>GitHub then makes the file part of our GitHub pages website.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Why we Store Files Locally</h1>

            <p>Here are a few examples of times when you might want to store images locally on your own site:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>If you took the picture yourself, and copied it directly from your camera or hard drive to your
                    repository.</li>
                <li>If you are concerned that a remote picture might take a long time to load.</li>
                <li>If you find an image on the web that you cannot link to directly for one reason or another. For
                    instance, some sites ask you to download their pictures rather than having you link to
                    them directly. This saves the site money, as they don't have to pay for hosting your image.</li>
                <li>If you find an image on the web that you can modify. In that case, you need to download it first,
                    modify it, and then store the modified file locally.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h1>Download an Image</h1>

            <p>
                Let's step through an example case where you would store a file locally. The site called <a href="https://pixabay.com/">pixabay</a>
                asks that you not link directly to their images. Instead, they want you to first, download the image,
                then store them locally on your website.
            </p>

            <p>
                To get started, go to a page like this:
            </p>

            <a href="https://pixabay.com/en/utah-mountain-sky-nature-440520/">https://pixabay.com/en/utah-mountain-sky-nature-440520/</a>

            <p>
                Download the image into a subdirectory of your repository called <b>images</b>.
            </p>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h1>Load the Image</h1>

            <p>Create a file called <b>download-image.html</b> in the root of your repository. Prep it as you usually
                would, and link in a CSS file of your choice. This CSS file must must be one that you created by hand.
                Finally, link to <b>download-image.html</b> from your GitHub pages home page. Your home page is usually
                called <b>index.html</b> and is located in the root of your repository.</p>

            <p>
                In your new HTML document, load the image you downloaded like this:
            </p>

            <pre>&lt;img src="images/utah-440520_640.jpg" alt="mountain sunset"&gt;</pre>

            <p>We don't just write the name of the <b>jpg</b> file. Instead, we write both the directory where the file is stored and the name of the image file.</p>
                
            <pre>src="images/utah-440520_640.jpg"</pre>
            
            <p>We do this because <b>download-images.html</b> is in the root of the site, but the <b>jpg</b> file is in the <b>images</b> directory. Note that this particular image does not require attribution. This fact is spelled out on the pixabay site.</p>

            <img class="normal-image" src="./images/utah-440520_640.jpg" alt="foo">

            <img class="normal-image" src="images/sparrow-3698507_640.jpg" alt="sparrow">

            <h1>Relative Paths</h1>

            <p>One of the most important subjects in web development involves composing relative paths. This is an
                absolute path:</p>

            <pre>&lt;img src="http://www.elvenware.com/foo.png" alt="foo"&gt;</pre>

            <p>Paths like this can be linked from anywhere in the web. But suppose you are trying to link to a document
                on your own web site. In those casees, you don't need to include the name of your website because you
                are already on your website. Instead, you can just enter the name of the file you want to link to.</p>

            <p>The trouble comes when you are in a subdirectory of your website and want to link to a document that is closer to the root
                of your site, or that is in a directory is closer to the root. Consider the case where you want to add a link from a file in your <b>theme</b> directory to an image in your <b>images</b> directory.</p>


            <pre>theme/index.html<br>images/foo.png</pre>

            <p>
                In that case, the load statement to the a file in the images directory
                would involve a relative path:
            </p>

            <pre>&lt;img src="../images/utah-440520_640.jpg" alt="utah mountains"&gt;</pre>

            <p>The funky looking <b>../images</b> syntax means that you are navigating back one directory closer to the root and then navigating into the <b>images directory.</b></p>

            <pre>theme/mountains/index.html<br>images/foo.png</pre>

            <p>
                Suppose you were in a directory called <b>theme/mountains</b>.</p> 

            <p>    
                Then you would do this:
            </p>

            <pre>&lt;img src="../../images/utah-440520_640.jpg" alt="utah mountains"&gt;</pre>

            <p>In this case you move back two directories before navigating into the <b>images</b> directory.</p>

            <h1>Turn it in</h1>

            <p>Check that the following are true:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Two images are stored in the images directory. One is the mountain image referenced above, the second is a file that fits in with your theme site.</li>
                <li>You display both images in the <b>download-images.html</b>. This HTML file should be in the root of your repository.</li>
                <li>You also display one of the local images in the <b>index.html</b> file from your <b>theme</b> directory.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>NOTE</b>: <i>In the midterm, I'm going to ask that you link to files that are stored on remote sites, and stored locally. So this will be a chance to ensure that the home page of your theme directory links to files of both types. In other words, this is both a stand alone assignment and a step toward your midterm. </i></p>
