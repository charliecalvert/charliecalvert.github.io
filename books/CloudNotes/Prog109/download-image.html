            <h1>Download and Load Local Images</h1>

            <p>So far we have been linking to images stored on remote sites such as the <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikimedia
                    Commons</a>. Some sites, however, ask you to download the pictures rather than having you link to
                their site directly. This saves the site money, as they don't have to pay for hosting your image. There
                will, of course, also be times when you want to use images that you took yourself. This assignment
                describes how to work with images that you have downloaded to your repository.</p>

            <h1>Download an Image</h1>

            <p>
                You have to take an extra step or two when using <a href="https://pixabay.com/">pixabay</a> images. First, download the image, then link to them
                locally.
            </p>

            <p>
                Go to a page like this:
            </p>

            <a href="https://pixabay.com/en/utah-mountain-sky-nature-440520/">https://pixabay.com/en/utah-mountain-sky-nature-440520/</a>

            <p>
                Download the image into a subdirectory of your repository called <b>images</b>.
            </p>

        </section>




        <section>
            <h1>Load the Image</h1>

            <p>
                Load the image you downloaded like this:
            </p>

            <pre>
            &lt;img src="images/utah-440520_640.jpg" alt="foo"&gt;
        </pre>

            From your theme directory, the load statement would involve a relative path:

            <pre>
            &lt;img src="../images/utah-440520_640.jpg" alt="utah mountains"&gt;
        </pre>

            <img src="images/utah-440520_640.jpg" alt="foo">

            <p>
                Note that this particular image does not require attribution.
