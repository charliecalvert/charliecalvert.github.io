            <h1>Download and Load Local Images</h1>

            <p>So far we have been linking to images stored on remote sites such as the <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikimedia
                    Commons</a>. Some sites, however, ask you to download the pictures rather than having you link to
                their site directly. This saves the site money, as they don't have to pay for hosting your image. There
                will, of course, also be times when you want to use images that you took yourself. This assignment
                describes how to work with images that you have downloaded to your repository.</p>

            <h1>Download an Image</h1>

            <p>
                You have to take an extra step or two when using <a href="https://pixabay.com/">pixabay</a> images. First, download the image, then link to them
                locally.
            </p>

            <p>
                Go to a page like this:
            </p>

            <a href="https://pixabay.com/en/utah-mountain-sky-nature-440520/">https://pixabay.com/en/utah-mountain-sky-nature-440520/</a>

            <p>
                Download the image into a subdirectory of your repository called <b>images</b>.
            </p>

        </section>




        <section>
            <h1>Load the Image</h1>

            <p>Create a file called <b>download-image.html</b> in the root of your repository. Prep it as you usually would, and link in a CSS file of your choice, but it must be a file that you created by hand.</p>

            <p>
                In your new HTML document, load the image you downloaded like this:
            </p>

            <pre>
            &lt;img src="images/utah-440520_640.jpg" alt="foo"&gt;
        </pre>

        <p>Note that this particular image does not require attribution.</p>

        <img src="images/utah-440520_640.jpg" alt="foo">

            <h1>Relative Paths</h1>

            <p>One of the most important subjects in web development involves composing relative paths. This is an absolute path:</p>

            <pre>&lt;http://www.elvenware.com/foo.html&gt;</pre>

            <p>Paths like this can be linked from anywhere in the web. But suppose you are trying to link to a document on your own web site. In those casees, you don't need to link in the name of your website because you are already on your website. Instead, you can just enter the name of the file you want to link to. The trouble comes when you are in a subdirectory and want to link to a document that is closer to the root of your site, or that is in a directory that closer to the root.</p>
            <p>
                From your theme directory, for instances, the load statement to the a file in the images directory would involve a relative path:
            </p>

            <pre>
            &lt;img src="../images/utah-440520_640.jpg" alt="utah mountains"&gt;
        </pre>
