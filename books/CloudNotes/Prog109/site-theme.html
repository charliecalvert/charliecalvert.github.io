        <h1>Site Theme</h1>

        <p>It's time to start thinking about the midterm. This assignment will be the first step on that path.</p>
        <p>The midterm will give you a chance to begin to develop a web site based in part on a theme of your choice. For instance, if you are interested in Frogs, then you could create a section of your site based on Frogs.</p>
        <p><b>NOTE: </b><i>Each student should have a unique theme, or at least a unique approach to their theme. Unless they truly are your passion, I'm expecting that Frogs will not be the subject you write on. Pick something you are interested in. </i></p>
        <p>The details of the midterm are not clear to me yet, but your site will contain:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Links to all the work you have done so far</li>
            <li>Links to a subdirectory that will contain at least seven pages dedicated to your unique theme.</li>            
        </ul>
        <p>For this assignment, I want you to</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a subdirectory of your repository called <b>theme</b>.</li>
            <li>In the <b>theme</b> directory put a file called <b>index.html. It will be the home page for your theme pages.</b></li>
            <li>In <b>theme/index.html</b> put:
                <ul>
                    <li>An <b>h1</b> element that acts as the title for your theme. For instance, if your theme is <b>Frogs</b> then your h1 element might contain the word <b>Frogs</b>.</li>
                    <li>Beneath the <b>h1</b>element place a <b>p</b> element describing your theme.</li>
                    <li>Also include an <b>img</b> element with a picture related to your theme. You can change the picture later, but get something in there to get started.</li>
                    <li>Hint: If your theme was Frogs then you might look on the Wikimedia for pictures of Frogs.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
