        <td>Unfortunately Washington State and Bellevue College do not allow people to sit in on classes they are not enrolled in. Sitting in a different section of 109 is technically a different class. Also, space is often limited in the classes at this time. Therefore if you need extra class time please try to form a study group with other students.&nbsp;</td>

This is for several reasons including copyright of educational content (both my content and BC's), the privacy of other students in the class, and my privacy.&nbsp; If you have permission of DRC then it is OK as long as you also agree not to post the recorded audio or video content to internet sites (public or private), or make any content available to anyone else in any format. Please understand that I want to be protective of my own image, and the images/audio of other students, floating around the Internet.</td>
