                <p>An integrated development environment (IDE) can be useful to some <em>web page
                    creators</em>. In this class we will probably use WebStorm or NotePad++.</p>
                <p>You may choose to spend the entire quarter working in just notepad++. You may also use another
                    environment such as Sublime Text, Aptana, Webstorm, Dreamweaver, Visual Studio Code, Brackets, or
                    any number of programs out there.</p>
                <p>My tool of choice is WebStorm. If you have no preferance, that will probably prove the simplest
                    choice for you.</p>

            <td>Some classes are more imporant than others, but each day will have new information. If you are unable to
                attend class then review the material on Canvas. For further information you will want to consult a
                fellow student, the book. and the syllabus. In general, my policy is to allow each student to miss one
                class without comment. If you miss multiple classes then my sympathy for any potential hardships you may
                encounter might be affected. I am not heartless, but I'm prejudice in favor of students who attend class
                regularly.

                often limited in the classes at this time. Therefore if you need extra class time please try to form a
                study group with other students.&nbsp;
