        <h1>The Parts of a URL</h1>

        <p>Every page and resource on the web has its own special address called a <strong>URL</strong>, or <strong>U</strong>niform <strong>R</strong>esource <strong>L</strong>ocator.</p>

        <h2>Anatomy of a URL</h2>
        <p>A URL is often made up of three components: the protocol, the domain name, and the path to a document or resource. An example URL is shown below:</p>

        <section><img class="normal-image" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket01.elvenware.com/images/url-syntax-s.png" alt="URL Syntax"></section>

        <h2>HTTPS Protocol</h2>
        <p>The letters HTTPS stand for <strong>HyperText Transfer Protocol</strong>. This is the technology websites use to transfer files across the internet.</p>

        <h2>Domain: www.example.com</h2>
        <p>The next portion of the URL identifies the website by its domain name. The <strong>www</strong> part is called a subdomain and <strong>.com</strong> is called a top level domain. Sometimes <strong>www</strong> may be omitted. There can be more than one website at a domain (sometimes called subdomains). For example, there might also be <em>development.example.com</em>, <em>clients.example.com</em>, and so on.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Optionally, we can include a port number. In most cases the port defaults to 80 (http) or 443 (https). Since those are the default values, we usually omit this portion of the URl.</p>

        <h2>Path and File: /images/example.png</h2>
        <p>This is the path and file name of the requested HTML document. The word <strong>images</strong> is the directory name, starting with the <strong>root directory </strong> of the host (as indicated by the initial <strong>/</strong>). Because the Internet has always primarily consisted of computers running the Unix operating system, we follow the Unix rules and convention for path separators; hence the <strong>/</strong> character for separating directory names.</p>
