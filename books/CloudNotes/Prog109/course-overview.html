        <p><strong>Welcome to Programming 109. </strong>In this course we will create content that appears in a user&rsquo;s
            web browser.</p>
        <p>A user's computer is called the client computer. As a result, we can say that this course focuses on
            client-side web development.</p>

    <h2>Technologies</h2>
    <p>There are 3 principle technologies involved:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>Cascading Style Sheets</li>
        <li>JavaScript programming language.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips</h2>

    <p>Here are a few tips for doing well in the class. Some of these may seem obvious, but statistics show that if you
        adhere to these tips then you&rsquo;ll do a lot better then just watching TV and eating chocolate popcorn all
        quarter.</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Each week, log into the web site on at least four separate days.</strong> <br/>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Complete all the reading assignments.</strong> This is easy the first week or two because we are all
            excited to learn, but we need to remain vigilant throughout the course.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Strive not to wait until the last hour to complete your assignments.</strong> I cannot stress
            this enough. Remember Murphy's Law and assume that there will be technical issues that delay your
            submission.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Ask technical questions in the discussion area.</strong>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Use the Canvas Worlshop and Guides. </strong><br/>On-campus Canvas workshops are available the first
            week of the quarter. <strong><a
