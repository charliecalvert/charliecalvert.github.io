    <h2><strong>The Parts of a URL<br /></strong></h2>
    <hr />
    <p>Every page and resource on the web has its own special address called a <strong>URL</strong>, or <strong>U</strong>niform <strong>R</strong>esource <strong>L</strong>ocator.</p>
    <p><strong>Anatomy of a URL</strong></p>
    <p>A complete URL is generally made up of three components: the protocol, the site name, and the absolute path to the document or resource, as shown below:</p>

    <p></p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL">What is a URL on MDN</a></p>

    <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket01.elvenware.com/images/url-syntax-s.png" alt="URL Syntax"></p>

    <pre>

protocol            port       file-name

https://example.com:80/images/example.png

domain         path
</pre>
    <p><strong>1) http://</strong><br />The first thing the URL does is define the protocol that will be used for that particular transaction. The letters HTTP let the server know to use <strong>HyperText Transfer Protocol,</strong> or get into "web mode".</p>
    <p><strong>2) www.example.com</strong><br />The next portion of the URL identifies the website by its domain name. In this example, the domain name is <em>example.com</em>. The "www." part at the beginning is the particular host name at that domain (a host is the computer or more precisely, the&nbsp;<em>server,</em> where the web site resides). The host name "www" has become a convention, but is not a rule. In fact, sometimes the host name may be omitted. There can be more than one website at a domain (sometimes called subdomains). For example, there might also be <em>development.example.com</em>, <em>clients.example.com</em>, and so on.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>3) /2015/samples/first.html</strong><br />This is the absolute path through directories on the server to the requested HTML document, <em>first.html</em>. The words separated by slashes are the directory names, starting with the <strong>root directory </strong>or highest level&nbsp;directory of the host (as indicated by the initial <strong>/</strong>). Because the Internet originally comprised computers running the Unix operating system, our current way of doing things still follows many Unix rules and conventions, hence the <strong>/</strong> separating directory names. &nbsp;</p>
    <p>To sum it up, the URL in our illustration above says it would like to use the <strong>HTTP</strong> protocol to connect to a web server on the Internet called <strong>www.example.com</strong>&nbsp;and request the document <strong>first.html</strong> (located in the <strong>samples</strong> directory, which is in the <strong>2015</strong> directory).</p>
