Styling a page in Jekyll can be done in several ways. Here are a few methods you can use:

1. Using LayoutsLayouts are templates that wrap around your page content. They are stored in the _layouts directory. Here's an example of a basic layout:

<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>{{ page.title }}</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/style.css">
</head>
<body>
  {{ content }}
</body>
</html>

To use this layout in a page, you would set the layout variable in the front matter of your page:

---

layout: default
title: My Page
---

# Welcome to My Page

This is a sample page.

2. Inline CSSYou can apply CSS directly within your HTML tags using the style attribute. For example:

<p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>

3. External StylesheetsYou can link to an external stylesheet in your layout or directly in your page. For example, in your layout:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/style.css">

And then, in your style.css file, you can add your CSS rules:

body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

h1 {
  color: blue;
}

4. Using Jekyll ThemesJekyll supports themes, which can be a great way to style your site without writing all the CSS yourself. You can add a theme to your site by specifying it in your _config.yml file:

theme: minima

You can find more information on Jekyll themes and how to customize them.
5. Customizing with SassJekyll also supports Sass, which is a CSS preprocessor that allows you to write more maintainable and reusable CSS. You can create a .scss file in your _sass directory and import it into your main stylesheet.

// _sass/_variables.scss
$primary-color: #333;

// assets/css/style.scss
@import "variables";

body {
  color: $primary-color;
}

These methods should help you style your Jekyll pages effectively. If you have any specific styling goals or challenges, feel free to share, and I can provide more targeted advice!
