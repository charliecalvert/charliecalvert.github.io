As of August 2023, there is a new [COVID-19](https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/info-2020/coronavirus-facts.html) surge. We are experiencing an increase in  cases and hospitalizations due to the  Eris EG.5 coronavirus that that now eclipses the [Arcturus](https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/info-2023/arcturus-new-covid-variant.html) (XBB.1.16) virus.

The CDC says EG.5 accounts for 20.6 percent of COVID infections. A strain called FL.1.5.1 nets 13.3%.
