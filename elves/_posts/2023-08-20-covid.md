As of August 2023, there is a new [COVID-19](https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/info-2020/coronavirus-facts.html) surge. We are experiencing an increase in  cases and hospitalizations due to the  Eris EG.5 coronavirus that that now eclipses the [Arcturus](https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/info-2023/arcturus-new-covid-variant.html) (XBB.1.16) virus.

The CDC says EG.5 accounts for 20.6 percent of COVID infections. A strain called FL.1.5.1 nets 13.3%.

The CDC doesn't mandate anything it recommends. The CDC is a government agency that provides information and recommendations to the public. The CDC is not a law making body. The CDC is not a regulatory agency.

There are convincing studies showing that masks work for individuals.Whether they work for larger communities as a whole is a different question. The point being that an individual can protect themselves while larger groups might not have the discipline to actually put their mask on and keep it on.

The CDC recommends that people wear masks in public settings, at events and gatherings, and anywhere they will be around other people.

In 2021 44% of Americans had faith in the American medical system, but by 2023 that number had dropped to 34%.

From August 15 to August 19 there were some 15,000 hospitalizationsa rise of 18 per cent from the previous week. The number of deaths rose 12 per cent to 1,500. 2% of the deaths in that.Due to COVID 19 which is a rise of 17%. About 152,000,000 Americans have been vaccinated.

## Electrolytes

Electrolytes are minerals found in our bodies. They help:

- Regulate water in our body
- Balance the body's acid/base (pH) level,
- Move nutrients into and out of cells.
- Support the proper function of our nerves, muscles, heart, and brain.

Sodium, calcium, potassium, chlorine, phosphate, and magnesium are all electrolytes. You get them from the foods you eat and the fluids you drink.

The levels of electrolytes in our bodies can become too low or too high. If this balance is disturbed, you can become dehydrated or overhydrated.

The **DV** or Daily Value Specifies government recommendations for daily intake of variouselectrolytes. 100% **DV** is the recommended amount for a day. 5% **DV** is low, 10% **DV** is still low, 20% **DV** is a little better.

Kates Farms has about 16% **DV** of Potassium, so 5 cartons gives 80% of **DV**. Four cartons provide 64% **DV**.

The Sodium in 5 cartons gives us 1750 mg or 1.75 grams. Four cartons provide 1400mg or 1.4 grams.  The Recommended **DV** is 3-5gram.

**The bottom line is that Kates Farms is a not a sufficient source of Potassium and is a low source of Sodium.** This means we need to make it up someplace else, but many of the available supplements do not come close to providing enough Potassium or Sodium.

## Electrolyte Supplements

In this section we take a look at some of the common electrolyte supplements and see how they stack up against the recommended **DV**. They are not particularly attractive solutions. See the next section, labelled **[Best Solutions](#best-solutions)** for some possible recommendations.

### Lassi

For lassi, The potassium is at 8% **DV**. There is no salt

- ![Lassi][01]

### Liquid IV

Liquid IV:

- Provides 8% **DV** potassium
- Sodium id 5% **DV**

- ![Liquid IV][02]

### Orange Juice

Two or three daily cups of orange juice would provide a significant amount of **Potassium** but no **Sodium**

- Potassium 10% **DV**
- Sodium 0% **DV**
- Protien 2 grams
- Carbs 26 grams (9% **DV**)

- ![Orange Juice][04]

## Grassmilk, Organic Valley

**Grassmilk** is interesting because I could have two or three cups a day which could give me **24 grams** of **protein** and 24% **DV** of **Potassium**. It would provide 15% **DV** of **Sodium** which is not insignificant.

- Potassium 8% **DV**
- Sodium 5% **DV**

- ![Grassmilk][05]

### Whey

The level of **Potassium** in **Whey** is very low, but it a good source of **Protein**.

- 2% **DV** for Potassium. *So low*!
- Sodium 6% **DV**.
- Protien 20 grams Which is **40% DV**.

<h2 id="best-solutions">Best Solutioins</h2>

**Potassium Chloride**, **Morton salt**, and **Salt for Life** may be the best solutions. They can provide good **DVs** for both **Potassium** and **Sodium**.

### Morton Salt

Morton Salt is inexpensive and a great source of **Sodium** but has no **Potassium**.

- ![Morton Salt][03]

### Salt for Life

Not as good as **Morton Salt** either in terms of the amount of sodium provided or in cost, but it does provide **Potassium**.

- [Potassium Salt for Life][06]

### Potassium Supplement

This is a good source of **Potassium** but it is expensive and does not provide **Sodium**.

- ![Potassium Supplement][07]
