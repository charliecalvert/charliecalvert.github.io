As of August 2023, there is a new [COVID-19](https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/info-2020/coronavirus-facts.html) surge. We are experiencing an increase in  cases and hospitalizations due to the  Eris EG.5 coronavirus that that now eclipses the [Arcturus](https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/info-2023/arcturus-new-covid-variant.html) (XBB.1.16) virus.

The CDC says EG.5 accounts for 20.6 percent of COVID infections. A strain called FL.1.5.1 nets 13.3%.

The CDC doesn't mandate anything it recommends. The CDC is a government agency that provides information and recommendations to the public. The CDC is not a law making body. The CDC is not a regulatory agency.

There are convincing studies showing that masks work for individuals.Whether they work for larger communities as a whole is a different question. The point being that an individual can protect themselves while larger groups might not have the discipline to actually put their mask on and keep it on.

The CDC recommends that people wear masks in public settings, at events and gatherings, and anywhere they will be around other people.

In 2021 44% of Americans had faith in the American medical system, but by 2023 that number had dropped to 34%.

From August 15 to August 19 there were some 15,000 hospitalizationsa rise of 18 per cent from the previous week. The number of deaths rose 12 per cent to 1,500. 2% of the deaths in that.Due to COVID 19 which is a rise of 17%. About 152,000,000 Americans have been vaccinated.

## Electrolytes

Electrolytes are minerals found in our bodies. They help:

- Regulate water in our body
- Balance body's acid/base (pH) level,
- Move nutrients into and out of cells. They also help make sure that your nerves, muscles, the heart, and the brain work the way they should.

Sodium, calcium, potassium, chlorine, phosphate, and magnesium are all electrolytes. You get them from the foods you eat and the fluids you drink.

The levels of electrolytes in your body can become too low or too high. This can happen when the amount of water in your body changes. The amount of water that you take in should equal the amount you lose. If something upsets this balance, you may have too little water (dehydration) or too much water (overhydration). Some medicines, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, and liver or kidney problems can all upset your water balance.

Treatment helps you to manage the imbalance. It also involves identifying and treating what caused the imbalance.

DV = Daily Value; It states how much should we have in one day. 100% DV is the recommended amount for a day. 5% DV is low, 10% DV is still low, 20% DV is a little better.

Kates Farms has about 16% DV Potassium, so 5 cartons gives 80% of DV, 4 gives us 64%. Sodium 5 gives us 1750 mg 1.75grams, 4 gives us 1400mg (1.4 grams).  Recommended dv is 3-5gram.

Lassi: For lassi, potassium 8% DV, better, but still low. No salt
