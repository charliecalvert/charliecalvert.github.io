## Voice Exercises

Belly (Diaphragm) Breathing:

- Place one hand on your chest and one hand on your belly
- Inhale: Breathe in through your nose. Think about breathing low to fill up the bottom of your
lungs. As you breathe in you should feel your belly press out. The hand on your chest should
stay relatively still.
- Exhale: Breathe out with pursed lips. As you breathe out gently contract your abdominals.
Think about pressing the air up from below as you exhale.
- Repeat this cycle ~10x.

Use this breathing throughout your stretching and voice exercises

### Stretches

Neck Stretches: Hold each position for 2 breath cycles. - Move slowly between each stretch. Repeat 3-5x.

- Ear to Shoulder - R & L
- Ear to Shoulder, tilt chin back - R & L
- Look Behind you - R & L
- Draw circles with your nose

### Jaw and Tongue Stretches

Hold 3-5 seconds as tolerated. Then Relax. Repeat x5.

- Yawn
- Tongue Stretches: You should feel these stretch in the back of your tongue and into the top of
your throat.
- Curl tip of tongue down onto lower teeth then press forward.
- Stick tongue out and down towards your chin

### Laryngeal Massage

- Place your fingers on the front of your throat and swallow. Find the bump the moves up and
then back down. This is the front of your thyroid cartilage. Think of this as 'home base'
- Then pinch your thumb and pointer fingers together at 'home base'. Then slide your fingers to
the sides of the cartilage.
- Add pressure to one side of your voice box. Gently press to the side and then slightly down.

Repeat 3-4 times on one side. Then move to the opposite side.
Its ok to increase pressure as tolerated. If you feel some clicking / popping as your press- don't
worry, that is normal.
Repeat for 3-5 cycles or until you feel like you need a break.
