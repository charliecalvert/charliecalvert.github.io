[GitHub][site] Copilot is built on top of the [OpenAI Codex][openai] and provides enhanced autocompletion inside Visual Studio code. You can trigger it either by starting to write code, or writing comments for the code that you want to create. It excels at certain tasks such as helping you write unit tests. Find more information on by visiting pages like this one by [LadyKerr][lady-kerr] entitled [Getting Started with GitHub Copilot Chat in VSCode][lksamples]

GitHub copilot is [free for teachers and students][edu]. If you are not already in the program go to the [GitHub Global Campus][ggcs] site and apply.

Others can go to the [Copilot website][site] on GitHub and sign up for a free trial. After the trial, copilot is $10 a month or $100 a year. To learn the status of your account, sign into GitHub and visit the following pages:

- [https://github.com/settings/copilot][site]
- [https://github.com/settings/billing][bill]

To install GitHub copilot in Visual Studio Code, go to the [Extensions Marketplace][ext] in VS Code (Ctrl-Shift-X) and search on GitHub Copilot.

A good way to get started would be to build a [simple project][simple] that you know how to complete and use the copilot suggestions to expedite the process. For instance, a teacher could take a simple Getting Started project and show how Copilot makes it easy to create.

## GPT-PILOT

[OpenAI][openai] is the company that created the [GPT-3][gpt3] language model. They have a new model called [Codex][codex] that is the basis for GitHub Copilot. You can try it out at [GPT-PILOT][pilot].
