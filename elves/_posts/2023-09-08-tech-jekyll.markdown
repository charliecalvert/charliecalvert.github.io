## Techniques for working with Jekyll

These are notes to help me track how I am using [Jekyll][jekyll].

I've created a series of scripts that begin with a word **SearchChaio** that do useful tasks.  I've also created a script called  **create-post.sh** that will create a new post.

find . -iname "202?-??-??-*" | sort -n -t _

// ^(.*)$ => less $1

## Learning to search

The following is a direct quote from a conversation with Bing on 9/12/2023.

>> To extract the last word of a string in bash, you can use the following command:

```bash
echo "Some variable has value abc.123" | awk '{print $NF}'
```

This command uses `awk` to break the input string into different fields using whitespace as the separator by default. `$NF` is a built-in `awk` variable that gives the total number of fields in the current record. Combining `$` with `NF` outputs the last field in the string, no matter how many fields your string contains ยน.

If you want to extract the last word after a specific string, you can use `awk` with `substr` and `index` functions as follows:

```bash
echo "Some variable has value abc.123" | awk '{print substr($0, index($0, "value") + length("value") + 1)}'
```

This command first finds the index of the word "value" in the input string using `index` function. It then adds the length of "value" and 1 to get the starting position of the last word. Finally, it uses `substr` function to extract the last word from that position till the end of the string .

To sort and remove duplicate rows from the extracted words, you can use `sort` and `uniq` commands as follows:

```bash
echo "Some variable has value abc.123" | awk '{print substr($0, index($0, "value") + length("value") + 1)}' | sort | uniq
```

This command sorts all words extracted from your input string in ascending order and removes any duplicate rows.

I hope this helps!
