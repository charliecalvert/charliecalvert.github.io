# Test

This is a test. I guess. More.

# Chapter 28

Sarah and Andy were walking down a carpeted hallway strung with glass chandeliers and lined with doorways interspersed with decorative tables holding flower arrangements and backed with large mirrors. It was a dazzling, even ostentatious display of wealth and comfort.

"This place makes me very nervous," Sarah said.

"You're just worried because we pass through the wormhole tomorrow."

Sarah sighed. The two of them turned left and passed through a large doorway into an elaborate dining room. A large rectangle wooden table with rounded corners stood in the middle of the room. Golden framed round mirrors hung on the wall, each with clear class chandeliers positioned just beneath, the lights from the lamps partially reflected in the mirrors, and casting elaborate shadows across the dark purple rug that covered the floor.

"You're damn straight I'm nervous about it," Sarah said. "And you'll be nervous too, after you've done it once. It sounds romantic, but it's not."
Andy walked up to one of the four place settings at the dinner table. A white lace placemat lay on the dark red stained bare wooden table. Cut glass goblets full of water stood before each place, and two wine glasses, now empty and upside down.

Sarah took the seat opposite Andy. Andrew King was already present, and sitting at the head of the table. General Anson sat at the end of the table.

"You have nothing to fear, Miss Ransom," General Anson said. "I assure you that it is safe to travel with us. This is the safest and best system for interplanetary travel that has ever been devised."

"And are you coming with us?" Sarah asked.
There was a brief pause, then General Anson shook his big bald head. His face was pale, and round, and he had slight double chin. "I'm sorry my dear, but I can't come with you. I wish I could, as this is an important matter, but I'm needed her right now."
